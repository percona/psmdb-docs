With auditing enabled, the server will generate an audit log file. This file contains information about different user events including authentication, authorization failures, and so on. To enable audit logging, specify where to send audit events using the --auditDestination option on the command line or the auditLog.destination variable in the configuration file. If you want to output events to a file, also specify the format of the file using the --auditFormat option or the auditLog.format variable, and the path to the file using the --auditPath option or the auditLog.path variable. To filter recorded events, use the --auditFilter option or the auditLog.filter variable. For example, to log only events from a user named tim and write them to a JSON file /var/log/psmdb/audit.json , start the server with the following parameters: $ mongod \\ --dbpath data/db --auditDestination file \\ --auditFormat JSON \\ --auditPath /var/log/psmdb/audit.json \\ --auditFilter '{ \"users.user\" : \"tim\" }' The options in the previous example can be used as variables in the MongoDB configuration file: storage: dbPath: data/db auditLog: destination: file format: JSON path: /var/log/psmdb/audit.json filter: '{ \"users.user\" : \"tim\" }' This example shows how to send audit events to the syslog . Specify the following parameters: mongod \\ --dbpath data/db --auditDestination syslog \\ Alternatively, you can edit the MongoDB configuration file: storage : dbPath : data/db auditLog : destination : syslog Note If you start the server with auditing enabled, you cannot disable auditing dynamically during runtime. Audit options \u00b6 The following options control audit logging: Command line Configuration file Type Description --auditDestination() auditLog.destination string Enables auditing and specifies where to send audit events: - console : Output audit events to stdout . - file : Output audit events to a file specified by the --auditPath option in a format specified by the --auditFormat option. - syslog : Output audit events to syslog --auditFilter() auditLog.filter string Specifies a filter to apply to incoming audit events, enabling the administrator to only capture a subset of them. The value must be interpreted as a query object with the following syntax: { <field1>: <expression1>, ... } Audit log events that match this query will be logged. Events that do not match this query will be ignored. For more information, see Audit filter examples --auditFormat() auditLog.format string Specifies the format of the audit log file, if you set the --auditDestination option to file . The default value is JSON . Alternatively, you can set it to BSON --auditPath() auditLog.path string Specifies the fully qualified path to the file where audit log events are written, if you set the --auditDestination option to file . If this option is not specified, then the auditLog.json file is created in the server\u2019s configured log path. If log path is not configured on the server, then the auditLog.json file is created in the current directory (from which mongod was started). NOTE : This file will rotate in the same manner as the system log path, either on server reboot or using the logRotate command. The time of rotation will be added to the old file\u2019s name. Audit message syntax \u00b6 Audit logging writes messages in JSON format with the following syntax: { atype : < String > , ts : { \"$date\" : < timestamp > }, local : { ip : < String > , port : < int > }, remote : { ip : < String > , port : < int > }, users : [ { user : < String > , db : < String > }, ... ], roles : [ { role : < String > , db : < String > }, ... ], param : < document > , result : < int > } Parameter Description atype Event type ts Date and UTC time of the event local Local IP address and port number of the instance remote Remote IP address and port number of the incoming connection associated with the event users Users associated with the event roles Roles granted to the user param Details of the event associated with the specific type result Exit code ( 0 for success) Audit filter examples \u00b6 The following examples demonstrate the flexibility of audit log filters. auditLog : destination : file filter : '{atype: {$in: [ \"authenticate\", \"authCheck\", \"renameCollection\", \"dropCollection\", \"dropDatabase\", \"createUser\", \"dropUser\", \"dropAllUsersFromDatabase\", \"updateuser\", \"grantRolesToUser\", \"revokeRolesFromUser\", \"createRole\", \"updateRole\", \"dropRole\", \"dropAllRolesFromDatabase\", \"grantRolesToRole\", \"revokeRolesFromRole\", \"grantPrivilegesToRole\", \"revokePrivilegesFromRole\", \"replSetReconfig\", \"enableSharding\", \"shardCollection\", \"addShard\", \"removeShard\", \"shutdown\", \"applicationMessage\" ]}}' Standard query selectors \u00b6 You can use query selectors, such as $eq , $in , $gt , $lt , $ne , and others to log multiple event types. For example, to log only the dropCollection and dropDatabase events: Command line Config file --auditDestination file --auditFilter '{ atype: { $in: [ \"dropCollection\", \"dropDatabase\" ] } }' auditLog : destination : file filter : '{ atype: { $in: [ \"dropCollection\", \"dropDatabase\" ] } }' Regular expressions \u00b6 Another way to specify multiple event types is using regular expressions. For example, to filter all drop operations: Command line Config file --auditDestination file --auditFilter '{ \"atype\" : /^drop.*/ }' auditLog : destination : file filter : '{ \"atype\" : /^drop.*/ }' Read and write operations \u00b6 By default, operations with successful authorization are not logged, so for this filter to work, enable auditAuthorizationSuccess parameter, as described in Enabling auditing of authorization success . For example, to filter read and write operations on all the collections in the test database: Note The dot ( . ) after the database name in the regular expression must be escaped with two backslashes ( \\\\\\\\ ). Command line Config file --setParameter auditAuthorizationSuccess = true --auditDestination file --auditFilter '{ atype: \"authCheck\", \"param.command\": { $in: [ \"find\", \"insert\", \"delete\", \"update\", \"findandmodify\" ] }, \"param.ns\": /^test\\\\./ } }' auditLog : destination : file filter : '{ atype: \"authCheck\", \"param.command\": { $in: [ \"find\", \"insert\", \"delete\", \"update\", \"findandmodify\" ] }, \"param.ns\": /^test\\\\./ } }' setParameter : { auditAuthorizationSuccess : true } Enabling auditing of authorization success \u00b6 By default, only authorization failures for the authCheck action are logged by the audit system. authCheck is for authorization by role-based access control, it does not concern authentication at logins. To enable logging of authorization successes, set the auditAuthorizationSuccess parameter to true . Audit events will then be triggered by every command, including CRUD ones. Warning Enabling the auditAuthorizationSuccess parameter heavily impacts the performance compared to logging only authorization failures. You can enable it on a running server using the following command: db . adminCommand ( { setParameter : 1 , auditAuthorizationSuccess : true } ) To enable it on the command line, use the following option when running mongod or mongos process: --setParameter auditAuthorizationSuccess = true You can also add it to the configuration file as follows: setParameter : auditAuthorizationSuccess : true","title":"Auditing"},{"location":"audit-logging.html#auditing","text":"Auditing allows administrators to track and log user activity on a MongoDB server.

Normally, a client needs to authenticate themselves against the MongoDB server user database before doing any work or reading any data from a mongod or mongos instance. By default, Percona Server for MongoDB provides a SCRAM authentication mechanism where clients authenticate themselves by providing their user credentials. In addition, you can integrate Percona Server for MongoDB with a separate service, such as OpenLDAP or Active Directory. This enables users to access the database with the same credentials they use for their emails or workstations. You can use any of these authentication mechanisms supported in Percona Server for MongoDB: SCRAM (default) x.509 certificate authentication LDAP authentication with SASL Kerberos Authentication Authentication and authorization with direct binding to LDAP SCRAM \u00b6 SCRAM is the default authentication mechanism. Percona Server for MongoDB verifies the credentials against the user\u2019s name, password and the database where the user record is created for a client (authentication database). For how to enable this mechanism, see Enabling Authentication . x.509 certificate authentication \u00b6 This authentication mechanism enables a client to authenticate in Percona Server for MongoDB by providing an x.509 certificate instead of user credentials. Each certificate contains the subject field defined in the format. In Percona Server for MongoDB, each certificate has a corresponding user record in the $external database. When a user connects to the database, Percona Server for MongoDB matches the subject value against the usernames defined in the $external database. For production use, we recommend using valid certificates. For testing purposes, you can generate and use self-signed certificates. x.509 authentication is compatible with with LDAP authorization to enable you to control user access and operations in Percona Server for MongoDB. For configuration guidelines, refer to Set up x.509 authentication and LDAP authorization . See also MongoDB Documentation: x.509 Percona Blog: Setting up MongoDB with Member x509 auth and SSL + easy-rsa LDAP authentication with SASL \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 LDAP authentication with means that both the client and the server establish a SASL session using the SASL library. Then authentication (bind) requests are sent to the LDAP server through the SASL authentication daemon ( saslauthd ) that acts as a remote proxy for the mongod server. The following components are necessary for external authentication to work: LDAP Server : Remotely stores all user credentials (i.e. user name and associated password). SASL Daemon : Used as a MongoDB server-local proxy for the remote LDAP service. SASL Library : Used by the MongoDB client and server to create data necessary for the authentication mechanism. The following image illustrates this architecture: An authentication session uses the following sequence: A mongo client connects to a running mongod instance. The client creates a PLAIN authentication request using the SASL library. The client then sends this SASL request to the server as a special mongo command. The mongod server receives this SASL Message, with its authentication request payload. The server then creates a SASL session scoped to this client, using its own reference to the SASL library. Then the server passes the authentication payload to the SASL library, which in turn passes it on to the saslauthd daemon. The saslauthd daemon passes the payload on to the LDAP service to get a YES or NO authentication response (in other words, does this user exist and is the password correct). The YES/NO response moves back from saslauthd , through the SASL library, to mongod . The mongod server uses this YES/NO response to authenticate the client or reject the request. If successful, the client has authenticated and can proceed. For configuration instructions, refer to Setting up LDAP authentication with SASL . Kerberos Authentication \u00b6 Percona Server for MongoDB supports Kerberos authentication starting from release 4.2.6-6. This authentication mechanism involves the use of a Key Distribution Center (KDC) - a symmetric encryption component which operates with tickets. A ticket is a small amount of encrypted data which is used for authentication. It is issued for a user session and has a limited lifetime. When using Kerberos authentication, you also operate with principals and realms. A realm is the logical network, similar to a domain, for all Kerberos nodes under the same master KDC. A principal is a user or a service which is known to Kerberos. A principal name is used for authentication in Kerberos. A service principal represents the service, e.g. mongodb . A user principal represents the user. The user principal name corresponds to the username in the $external database in Percona Server for MongoDB . The following diagram shows the authentication workflow: The sequence is the following: A mongo client sends the Ticket-Grantng Ticket (TGT) request to the Key Distribution Center (KDC) The KDC issues the ticket and sends it to the mongo client. The mongo client sends the authentication request to the mongo server presenting the ticket. The mongo server validates the ticket in the KDC. Upon successful ticket validation, the authentication request is approved and the user is authenticated.

You create and manage user credentials and permission information in the LDAP server. In addition, you create roles in the admin database with the names that exactly match the LDAP group Distinguished Name. These roles define what privileges the users who belong to the corresponding LDAP group. Supported authentication mechanisms \u00b6 LDAP authorization is compatible with the following authentication mechanisms: x.509 certificate authentication Kerberos Authentication Authentication and authorization with direct binding to LDAP Authentication and authorization with direct binding to LDAP \u00b6 Starting with release 4.2.5-5, you can configure Percona Server for MongoDB to communicate with the LDAP server directly to authenticate and also authorize users. The advantage of using this mechanism is that it is easy to setup and does not require pre-creating users in the dummy $external db. Nevertheless, the --authenticationDatabase connection argument will still need to be specified as $external . The following example illustrates the connection to Percona Server for MongoDB from the mongo shell: $ mongo -u \"CN=alice,CN=Users,DC=engineering,DC=example,DC=com\" -p --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism PLAIN The following diagram illustrates the authentication and authorization flow: A user connects to the db providing their credentials If required, Percona Server for MongoDB transforms the username to match the user in the LDAP server according to the mapping rules specified for the --ldapUserToDNMapping parameter. Percona Server for MongoDB queries the LDAP server for the user identity and /or the LDAP groups this user belongs to. The LDAP server evaluates the query and if a user exists, returns their LDAP groups. Percona Server for MongoDB authorizes the user by mapping the DN of the returned groups against the roles assigned to the user in the admin database. If a user belongs to several groups they receive permissions associated with every group. Username transformation \u00b6 If clients connect to Percona Server for MongoDB with usernames that are not LDAP , these usernames must be converted to the format acceptable by LDAP. To achieve this, the --ldapUserToDNMapping parameter is available in Percona Server for MongoDB configuration. The --ldapUserToDNMapping parameter is a JSON string representing an ordered array of rules expressed as JSON documents. Each document provides a regex pattern ( match field) to match against a provided username. If that pattern matches, there are two ways to continue: If there is the substitution value, then the matched pattern becomes the username of the user for further processing. If there is the ldapQuery value, the matched pattern is sent to the LDAP server and the result of that LDAP query becomes the of the user for further processing. Both substitution and ldapQuery should contain placeholders to insert parts of the original username \u2013 those placeholders are replaced with regular expression submatches found on the match stage. So having an array of documents, Percona Server for MongoDB tries to match each document against the provided name and if it matches, the name is replaced either with the substitution string or with the result of the LDAP query. LDAP referrals \u00b6 As of version 4.2.10-11, Percona Server for MongoDB supports LDAP referrals as defined in RFC 4511 4.1.10 . For security reasons, referrals are disabled by default. Double-check that using referrals is safe before enabling them. To enable LDAP referrals, set the ldapFollowReferrals server parameter to true using the setParameter command or by editing the configuration file. setParameter : ldapFollowReferrals : true Connection pool \u00b6 As of version 4.2.10-11, Percona Server for MongoDB always uses a connection pool to LDAP server to process bind requests. The connection pool is enabled by default. The default connection pool size is 2 connections. You can change the connection pool size either at the server startup or dynamically by specifying the value for the ldapConnectionPoolSizePerHost server parameter. For example, to set the number of connections in the pool to 5, use the setParameter command: Command line Configuration file > db . adminCommand ( { setParameter : 1 , ldapConnectionPoolSizePerHost : 5 } ) setParameter : ldapConnectionPoolSizePerHost : 5 Support for multiple LDAP servers \u00b6 As of version 4.2.12-13, you can specify multiple LDAP servers for failover. Percona Server for MongoDB sends bind requests to the first server defined in the list. When this server is down or unavailable, it sends requests to the next server and so on. Note that Percona Server for MongoDB keeps sending requests to this server even after the unavailable server recovers. Specify the LDAP servers as a comma-separated list in the format <host>:<port> for the \u2013ldapServers option. You can define the option value at the server startup by editing the configuration file. security : authorization : \"enabled\" ldap : servers : \"ldap1.example.net,ldap2.example.net\" You can change ldapServers dynamically at runtime using the setParameter . > db . adminCommand ( { setParameter : 1 , ldapServers : \"localhost,ldap1.example.net,ldap2.example.net\" } ) { \"was\" : \"ldap1.example.net,ldap2.example.net\" , \"ok\" : 1 } See also MongoDB Documentation: Authenticate and Authorize Users Using Active Directory via Native LDAP LDAP referrals Configuration \u00b6 For how to configure LDAP authorization with the native LDAP authentication, see Setting up LDAP authentication and authorization using NativeLDAP .","title":"LDAP authorization"},{"location":"authorization.html#ldap-authorization","text":"LDAP authorization allows you to control user access and operations in your database environment using the centralized user management storage \u2013 an LDAP server.

The advantage of using this mechanism is that it is easy to setup and does not require pre-creating users in the dummy $external db. Nevertheless, the --authenticationDatabase connection argument will still need to be specified as $external . The following example illustrates the connection to Percona Server for MongoDB from the mongo shell: $ mongo -u \"CN=alice,CN=Users,DC=engineering,DC=example,DC=com\" -p --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism PLAIN The following diagram illustrates the authentication and authorization flow: A user connects to the db providing their credentials If required, Percona Server for MongoDB transforms the username to match the user in the LDAP server according to the mapping rules specified for the --ldapUserToDNMapping parameter. Percona Server for MongoDB queries the LDAP server for the user identity and /or the LDAP groups this user belongs to. The LDAP server evaluates the query and if a user exists, returns their LDAP groups. Percona Server for MongoDB authorizes the user by mapping the DN of the returned groups against the roles assigned to the user in the admin database.

The --ldapUserToDNMapping parameter is a JSON string representing an ordered array of rules expressed as JSON documents. Each document provides a regex pattern ( match field) to match against a provided username. If that pattern matches, there are two ways to continue: If there is the substitution value, then the matched pattern becomes the username of the user for further processing. If there is the ldapQuery value, the matched pattern is sent to the LDAP server and the result of that LDAP query becomes the of the user for further processing. Both substitution and ldapQuery should contain placeholders to insert parts of the original username \u2013 those placeholders are replaced with regular expression submatches found on the match stage.

Stands for Atomicity , Consistency , Isolation , Durability . Atomicity \u00b6 Atomicity means that database operations are applied following a \u201call or nothing\u201d rule. A transaction is either fully applied or not at all. Consistency \u00b6 Consistency means that each transaction that modifies the database takes it from one consistent state to another. Durability \u00b6 Once a transaction is committed, it will remain so. Foreign Key \u00b6 A referential constraint between two tables. Example: A purchase order in the purchase_orders table must have been made by a customer that exists in the customers table. Isolation \u00b6 The Isolation requirement means that no transaction can interfere with another. Jenkins \u00b6 Jenkins is a continuous integration system that we use to help ensure the continued quality of the software we produce. It helps us achieve the aims of: no failed tests in trunk on any platform, aid developers in ensuring merge requests build and test on all platforms, no known performance regressions (without a damn good explanation).

Data fully resides in the main memory, making processing much faster and smoother. Keep in mind that you need to have enough memory to hold the data set, and ensure that the server does not shut down. The Percona Memory Engine is available in Percona Server for MongoDB along with the default MongoDB engine WiredTiger . Usage \u00b6 As of version 3.2, Percona Server for MongoDB runs with WiredTiger by default. You can select a storage engine using the --storageEngine command-line option when you start mongod . Alternatively, you can set the storage.engine variable in the configuration file (by default, /etc/mongod.conf ): storage : dbPath : <dataDir> engine : inMemory Configuration \u00b6 You can configure Percona Memory Engine using either command-line options or corresponding parameters in the /etc/mongod.conf file. The following are the configuration examples: Configuration file Command line The configuration file is formatted in YAML storage : engine : inMemory inMemory : engineConfig : inMemorySizeGB : 140 statisticsLogDelaySecs : 0 Setting parameters in the configuration file is the same as starting the mongod daemon with the following options: mongod --storageEngine = inMemory \\ --inMemorySizeGB = 140 \\ --inMemoryStatisticsLogDelaySecs = 0 Options \u00b6 The following options are available (with corresponding YAML configuration file parameters): Command line Configuration file Default Description --inMemorySizeGB() storage.inMemory.engineConfig.inMemorySizeGB 50% of total memory minus 1024 MB, but not less than 256 MB Specifies the maximum memory in gigabytes to use for data --inMemoryStatisticsLogDelaySecs() storage.inMemory.engineConfig.statisticsLogDelaySecs 0 Specifies the number of seconds between writes to statistics log. If 0 is specified then statistics are not logged Switching storage engines \u00b6 Considerations \u00b6 If you have data files in your database and want to change to Percona Memory Engine, consider the following: Data files created by one storage engine are not compatible with other engines, because each one has its own data model. When changing the storage engine, the mongod node requires an empty dbPath data directory when it is restarted. Though Percona Memory Engine stores all data in memory, some metadata files, diagnostics logs and statistics metrics are still written to disk. This is controlled with the --inMemoryStatisticsLogDelaySecs option. Creating a new dbPath data directory for a different storage engine is the simplest solution. Yet when you switch between disk-using storage engines (e.g. from WiredTiger to Percona Memory Engine), you may have to delete the old data if there is not enough disk space for both. Double-check that your backups are solid and/or the replica set nodes are healthy before you switch to the new storage engine. Procedure \u00b6 To change a storage engine, you have the following options: Temporarily test Percona Memory Engine \u00b6 Set a different data directory for the dbPath variable in the configuration file. Make sure that the user running mongod has read and write permissions for the new data directory. Stop mongod $ service mongod stop Edit the configuration file storage : dbPath : <newDataDir> engine : inmemory Start mongod $ service mongod start Permanent switch to Percona Memory Engine without any valuable data in your database \u00b6 Clean out the dbPath data directory (by default, /var/lib/mongodb ) and edit the configuration file: Stop mongod $ service mongod stop Clean out the dbPath data directory $ sudo rm -rf <dbpathDataDir> Edit the configuration file storage : dbPath : <newDataDir> engine : inmemory Start mongod $ service mongod start Switch to Percona Memory Engine with data migration and compatibility \u00b6 Standalone instance Replica set For a standalone instance or a single-node replica set, use the mongodump and mongorestore utilities: Export the dataDir contents $ mongodump --out <dumpDir> Stop mongod $ service mongod stop Clean out the dbPath data directory $ sudo rm -rf <dbpathDataDir> Update the configuration file by setting the new value for the storage.engine variable. Set the engine-specific settings such as storage.inMemory.engineConfig.inMemorySizeGB Start mongod $ service mongod start Restore the database $ mongorestore <dumpDir> Use the \u201crolling restart\u201d process. Switch to the Percona Memory Engine on the secondary node. Clean out the dbPath data directory and edit the configuration file: Stop mongod $ service mongod stop Clean out the dbPath data directory $ sudo rm -rf <dbpathDataDir> Edit the configuration file storage : dbPath : <newDataDir> engine : inmemory Start mongod $ service mongod start Wait for the node to rejoin with the other nodes and report the SECONDARY status. Repeat the procedure to switch the remaining nodes to Percona Memory Engine. Data at rest encryption \u00b6 Using Data at Rest Encryption means using the same storage.\\* configuration options as for WiredTiger .

We recommend testing this setup in a non-production environment first, before applying it in production. Assumptions \u00b6 The setup of an LDAP server is out of scope of this document. We assume that you are familiar with the LDAP server schema. You have the LDAP server up and running and it is accessible to the servers with Percona Server for MongoDB installed. This document primarily focuses on OpenLDAP used as the LDAP server and the examples are given based on the OpenLDAP format. If you are using Active Directory, refer to the Active Directory configuration section. You have the sudo privilege to the server with the Percona Server for MongoDB installed. Prerequisites \u00b6 In this setup we use anonymous binds to the LDAP server. If your LDAP server disallows anonymous binds, create the user that Percona Server for MongoDB will use to connect to and query the LDAP server. Define this user\u2019s credentials for the security.ldap.bind.queryUser and security.ldap.bind.queryPassword parameters in the mongod.conf configuration file. In this setup, we use the following OpenLDAP groups: dn: cn=testusers,dc=percona,dc=com objectClass: groupOfNames cn: testusers member: cn=alice,dc=percona,dc=com dn: cn=otherusers,dc=percona,dc=com objectClass: groupOfNames cn: otherusers member: cn=bob,dc=percona,dc=com Setup procedure \u00b6 Configure TLS/SSL connection for Percona Server for MongoDB \u00b6 By default, Percona Server for MongoDB establishes the TLS connection when binding to the LDAP server and thus, it requires access to the LDAP certificates. To make Percona Server for MongoDB aware of the certificates, do the following: Place the certificate in the certs directory. The path to the certs directory is: On Debian / Ubuntu: /etc/ssl/certs/ On RHEL / CentOS: /etc/openldap/certs/ Specify the path to the certificates in the ldap.conf file: Debian / Ubuntu RHEL and derivatives tee -a /etc/openldap/ldap.conf <<EOF TLS_CACERT /etc/ssl/certs/my_CA.crt EOF tee -a /etc/openldap/ldap.conf <<EOF TLS_CACERT /etc/openldap/certs/my_CA.crt EOF Create roles for LDAP groups in Percona Server for MongoDB \u00b6 Percona Server for MongoDB authorizes users based on LDAP group membership. For every group, you must create the role in the admin database with the name that exactly matches the DN of the LDAP group. Percona Server for MongoDB maps the user\u2019s LDAP group to the roles and determines what role is assigned to the user. Percona Server for MongoDB then grants privileges defined by this role. To create the roles, use the following command: var admin = db . getSiblingDB ( \"admin\" ) db . createRole ( { role : \"cn=testusers,dc=percona,dc=com\" , privileges : [], roles : [ \"readWrite\" ] } ) db . createRole ( { role : \"cn=otherusers,dc=percona,dc=com\" , privileges : [], roles : [ \"read\" ] } ) Percona Server for MongoDB configuration \u00b6 Access without username transformation \u00b6 This section assumes that users connect to Percona Server for MongoDB by providing their LDAP DN as the username. Edit the Percona Server for MongoDB configuration file (by default, /etc/mongod.conf ) and specify the following configuration: security : authorization : \"enabled\" ldap : servers : \"ldap.example.com\" transportSecurity : tls authz : queryTemplate : \"dc=percona,dc=com??sub?(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(member={PROVIDED_USER}))\" setParameter : authenticationMechanisms : \"PLAIN\" The {PROVIDED_USER} variable substitutes the provided username before authentication or username transformation takes place. Replace ldap.example.com with the hostname of your LDAP server. In the LDAP query template, replace the domain controllers percona and com with those relevant to your organization. Restart the mongod service: $ sudo systemctl restart mongod Test the access to Percona Server for MongoDB: $ mongo -u \"cn=alice,dc=percona,dc=com\" -p \"secretpwd\" --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism 'PLAIN' Access with username transformation \u00b6 If users connect to Percona Server for MongoDB with usernames that are not LDAP DN , you need to transform these usernames to be accepted by the LDAP server. Using the --ldapUserToDNMapping configuration parameter allows you to do this. You specify the match pattern as a regexp to capture a username. Next, specify how to transform it - either to use a substitution value or to query the LDAP server for a username. If you don\u2019t know what the substitution or LDAP query string should be, please consult with the LDAP administrators to figure this out. Note that you can use only the query or the substitution stage, the combination of two is not allowed. Substitution LDAP query Edit the Percona Server for MongoDB configuration file (by default, /etc/mongod.conf ) and specify the userToDNMapping parameter: security : authorization : \"enabled\" ldap : servers : \"ldap.example.com\" transportSecurity : tls authz : queryTemplate : \"dc=percona,dc=com??sub?(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(member={USER}))\" userToDNMapping : >- [ { match: \"([^@]+)@percona\\\\.com\", substitution: \"CN={0},DC=percona,DC=com\" } ] setParameter : authenticationMechanisms : \"PLAIN\" The {USER} variable substitutes the username transformed during the userToDNMapping stage. Modify the given example configuration to match your deployment. Restart the mongod service: $ sudo systemctl restart mongod Test the access to Percona Server for MongoDB: $ mongo -u \"alice@percona.com\" -p \"secretpwd\" --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism 'PLAIN' Edit the Percona Server for MongoDB configuration file (by default, /etc/mongod.conf ) and specify the userToDNMapping parameter: security : authorization : \"enabled\" ldap : servers : \"ldap.example.com\" transportSecurity : tls authz : queryTemplate : \"dc=percona,dc=com??sub?(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(member={USER}))\" userToDNMapping : >- [ { match: \"([^@]+)@percona\\\\.com\", ldapQuery: \"dc=percona,dc=com??sub?(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(cn={0}))\" } ] setParameter : authenticationMechanisms : \"PLAIN\" The {USER} variable substitutes the username transformed during the userToDNMapping stage. Modify the given example configuration to match your deployment, For example, replace ldap.example.com with the hostname of your LDAP server. Replace the domain controllers (DC) percona and com with those relevant to your organization. Depending on your LDAP schema, further modifications of the LDAP query may be required. Restart the mongod service: $ sudo systemctl restart mongod Test the access to Percona Server for MongoDB: mongo -u \"alice\" -p \"secretpwd\" --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism 'PLAIN' Active Directory configuration \u00b6 Microsoft Active Directory uses a different schema for user and group definition. To illustrate Percona Server for MongoDB configuration, we will use the following AD users: dn:CN=alice,CN=Users,DC=testusers,DC=percona,DC=com userPrincipalName: alice@testusers.percona.com memberOf: CN=testusers,CN=Users,DC=percona,DC=com dn:CN=bob,CN=Users,DC=otherusers,DC=percona,DC=com userPrincipalName: bob@otherusers.percona.com memberOf: CN=otherusers,CN=Users,DC=percona,DC=com The following are respective groups: dn:CN=testusers,CN=Users,DC=percona,DC=com member:CN=alice,CN=Users,DC=testusers,DC=example,DC=com dn:CN=otherusers,CN=Users,DC=percona,DC=com member:CN=bob,CN=Users,DC=otherusers,DC=example,DC=com Use one of the given Percona Server for MongoDB configurations for user authentication and authorization in Active Directory: No username transformation Username substitution LDAP query Edit the /etc/mongod.conf configuration file: ldap : servers : \"ldap.example.com\" authz : queryTemplate : \"DC=percona,DC=com??sub?(&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={PROVIDED_USER}))\" setParameter : authenticationMechanisms : \"PLAIN\" Restart the mongod service: $ sudo systemctl restart mongod Test the access to Percona Server for MongoDB: $ mongo -u \"CN=alice,CN=Users,DC=testusers,DC=percona,DC=com\" -p \"secretpwd\" --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism 'PLAIN' Edit the /etc/mongod.conf configuration file: ldap : servers : \"ldap.example.com\" authz : queryTemplate : \"DC=percona,DC=com??sub?(&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={USER}))\" userToDNMapping : >- [ { match: \"([^@]+)@([^\\\\.]+)\\\\.percona\\\\.com\", substitution: \"CN={0},CN=Users,DC={1},DC=percona,DC=com\" } ] setParameter : authenticationMechanisms : \"PLAIN\" Restart the mongod service: $ sudo systemctl restart mongod Test the access to Percona Server for MongoDB: $ mongo -u \"alice@percona.com\" -p \"secretpwd\" --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism 'PLAIN' Edit the /etc/mongod.conf configuration file: ldap : servers : \"ldap.example.com\" authz : queryTemplate : \"DC=percona,DC=com??sub?(&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={USER}))\" userToDNMapping : >- [ { match: \"(.+)\", ldapQuery: \"dc=example,dc=com??sub?(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(userPrincipalName={0}))\" } ] setParameter : authenticationMechanisms : \"PLAIN\" Restart the mongod service: $ sudo systemctl restart mongod Test the access to Percona Server for MongoDB: $ mongo -u \"alice\" -p \"secretpwd\" --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism 'PLAIN' Modify one of this example configuration to match your deployment.

For compatibility reasons, rate limit of 0 is the same as setting it to 1, and will effectively disable the feature meaning that every query will be profiled. The MongoDB database profiler can operate in one of three modes: 0 : Profiling is disabled. This is the default setting. 1 : The profiler collects data only for slow queries. By default, queries that take more than 100 milliseconds to execute are considered slow . 2 : Collects profiling data for all database operations. Mode 1 ignores all fast queries, which may be the cause of problems that you are trying to find.

The following steps will help you configure your environment: Assumptions \u00b6 Before we move on to the configuration steps, we assume the following: You have the LDAP server up and running and have configured users on it. The LDAP server is accessible to the server with Percona Server for MongoDB installed. This document focuses on OpenLDAP server. If you use Microsoft Windows Active Directory, see the Microsoft Windows Active Directory section for saslauthd configuration. You must place these two servers behind a firewall as the communications between them will be in plain text. This is because the SASL mechanism of PLAIN can only be used when authenticating and credentials will be sent in plain text. You have sudo privilege to the server with the Percona Server for MongoDB installed. Configure saslauthd \u00b6 Install the SASL packages. Depending on your OS, use the following command: Debian and Ubuntu RHEL and derivatives $ sudo apt install -y sasl2-bin $ sudo yum install -y cyrus-sasl NOTE : For Percona Server for MongoDB versions earlier than 4.0.26-21, 4.4.8-9, 4.2.16-17, also install the cyrus-sasl-plain package. Configure SASL to use ldap as the authentication mechanism. Note Back up the original configuration file before making changes.

This allows the saslauthd service to connect to the LDAP service as admin. In production, this would not be the case; users should not store administrative passwords in unencrypted files. In order for LDAP operations to be performed against a Windows Active Directory server, a user record must be created to perform the lookups. The following example shows configuration parameters for saslauthd to communicate with an Active Directory server: ldap_servers: ldap://localhost ldap_mech: PLAIN ldap_search_base: CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com ldap_filter: (sAMAccountName=%u) ldap_bind_dn: CN=ldapmgr,CN=Users,DC=<AD Domain>,DC=<AD TLD> ldap_password: ld@pmgr_Pa55word In order to determine and test the correct search base and filter for your Active Directory installation, the Microsoft LDP GUI Tool can be used to bind and search the LDAP-compatible directory. Start the saslauthd process and set it to run at restart: $ sudo systemctl start saslauthd $ sudo systemctl enable saslauthd Give write permissions to the /run/saslauthd folder for the mongod . Either change permissions to the /run/saslauthd folder: $ sudo chmod 755 /run/saslauthd Or add the mongod user to the sasl group: $ sudo usermod -a -G sasl mongod Sanity check \u00b6 Verify that the saslauthd service can authenticate against the users created in the LDAP service: $ testsaslauthd -u christian -p secret -f /var/run/saslauthd/mux This should return 0:OK \"Success\" . If it doesn\u2019t, then either the user name and password are not in the LDAP service, or sasaluthd is not configured properly. Configure libsasl2 \u00b6 The mongod also uses the SASL library for communications. To configure the SASL library, create a configuration file. The configuration file must be named mongodb.conf and placed in a directory where libsasl2 can find and read it. libsasl2 is hard-coded to look in certain directories at build time. This location may be different depending on the installation method. In the configuration file, specify the following: pwcheck_method: saslauthd saslauthd_path: /var/run/saslauthd/mux log_level: 5 mech_list: plain The first two entries ( pwcheck_method and saslauthd_path ) are required for mongod to successfully use the saslauthd service. The log_level is optional but may help determine configuration errors.

This user is required to log in to Percona Server for MongoDB after the external authentication is enabled. Editing the configuration file to enable the external authentication Create a root user \u00b6 Create a user with the root privileges in the admin database.

Thus, at this step, you create the user in the $external database and they inherit the roles and privileges. Note that the username must exactly match the name of the user object on the LDAP server. Connect to Percona Server for MongoDB and authenticate as the root user. $ mongo --host localhost --port 27017 -u admin -p '$3cr3tP4ssw0rd' --authenticationDatabase 'admin' Use the following command to add an external user to Percona Server for MongoDB: > db . getSiblingDB ( \"$external\" ). createUser ( { user : \"christian\" , roles : [ { role : \"read\" , db : \"test\" } ]} ); Authenticate as an external user in Percona Server for MongoDB \u00b6 When running the mongo client, a user can authenticate against a given database using the following command: > db . getSiblingDB ( \"$external\" ). auth ({ mechanism : \"PLAIN\" , user : \"christian\" , pwd : \"secret\" , digestPassword : false }) Alternatively, a user can authenticate while connecting to Percona Server for MongoDB: $ mongo --host localhost --port 27017 --authenticationMechanism PLAIN --authenticationDatabase \\$ external -u christian -p This section is based on the blog post Percona Server for MongoDB Authentication Using Active Directory by Doug Duncan :","title":"Set up LDAP authentication with SASL"},{"location":"sasl-auth.html#set-up-ldap-authentication-with-sasl","text":"This document describes an example configuration suitable only to test out the external authentication functionality in a non-production environment.

Considerations \u00b6 For testing purposes, in this tutorial we use OpenSSL to issue self-signed certificates. For production use, we recommend using certificates issued and signed by the CA in Percona Server for MongoDB. Client certificates must meet the client certificate requirements .

User management is done on the LDAP server so when a client connects to the database, they are authenticated and authorized through the LDAP server. Create roles \u00b6 At this step, create the roles in the admin database with the names that exactly match the names of the user groups on the LDAP server. These roles are used for user LDAP authorization in Percona Server for MongoDB. In our example, we create the role cn=otherusers,dc=percona,dc=com that has the corresponding LDAP group. var admin = db . getSiblingDB ( \"admin\" ) db . createRole ( { role : \"cn=otherusers,dc=percona,dc=com\" , privileges : [], roles : [ \"userAdminAnyDatabase\" , \"clusterMonitor\" , \"clusterManager\" , \"clusterAdmin\" ] } ) Output: { \"role\" : \"cn=otherusers,dc=percona,dc=com\" , \"privileges\" : [ ], \"roles\" : [ \"userAdminAnyDatabase\" , \"clusterMonitor\" , \"clusterManager\" , \"clusterAdmin\" ] } Enable x.509 authentication \u00b6 Stop the mongod service $ sudo systemctl stop mongod Edit the /etc/mongod.conf configuration file. net : port : 27017 bindIp : 127.0.0.1 tls : mode : requireTLS certificateKeyFile : /var/lib/mongocerts/server.pem CAFile : /var/lib/mongocerts/ca.crt security : authorization : enabled ldap : servers : \"ldap.example.com\" transportSecurity : none authz : queryTemplate : \"dc=percona,dc=com??sub?(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(member={USER}))\" setParameter : authenticationMechanisms : PLAIN,MONGODB-X509 Replace ldap.example.com with the hostname of your LDAP server.

It specifically includes multiple fixes relate to sharding and the resharding operation. Bugs of note are the following: SERVER-66418 - Fixed the issue with bad projection created during dependency analysis due to string order assumption. It resulted in the PathCollision error. The issue is fixed by improving dependency analysis for projections by folding dependencies into ancestor dependencies where possible. SERVER-65821 - Fixed the deadlock situation in cross shard transactions that could occur when the FCV (Feature Compatibility Version) was set after the \u201cprepared\u201d state of the transactions. That ended up with both the the setFCV thread and the TransactionCoordinator hung. SERVER-65131 - This is a v6.0 backport fix to v5.0 that disables opportunistic read targeting (except for specified hedged reads) in order to prevent possible performance problems associated with uneven read distribution across the secondaries. SERVER-66433 - Backported the check for user errors in case deadline on the migration destination manager is hit while waiting for a range to be cleared up. This prevents the balancer from getting blocked. SERVER-67457 - Fixed the situation where the shards may skip certain steps in the resharding process but respond to the resharding coordinator as if they had. This can cause the resharding coordinator to continue to wait for updated states in the config.reshardingOperations document on the primary config server and stall indefinitely. SERVER-66866 - Fixed the potential for the range deleter to wait unnecessarily during concurrent migrations between batches. SERVER-66727 Fixed the issue where 2 very different measurements (one in the past and one in future) could be incorrectly included in the same buckettime-series bucket.

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following: SERVER-68477 - Fixed the bug where an unexpected behavior could negatively impact existing TTL indexes with improper configuration and could cause the sudden expiration of TTL-indexed documents in a collection. This sudden expiration could cause data to be aged out prior than planned and could negatively impact write performance. This bug involves TTL indexes with the expireAfterSeconds value of NaN (not-a-number). The TTL indexes are treated as 0 instead of NaN and that resulted in the sudden expiration of TTL-indexed documents in a collection. The bug affects MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.13 and MongoDB 6.0.0 through 6.0.1. It could be hit on MongoDB 4.4/4.2 when initially syncing from a 5.0.0-5.0.13 or 6.0.0-6.0.1 node and on MongoDB 5.0.0-5.0.13 when restoring from a mongodump of 4.2 / 4.4 collection or initially syncing from a 4.2/4.4 node that has a TTL configured with expireAfterSeconds: NaN. The issue is fixed upstream in version 5.0.14 and 6.0.2. As the general recommendation, avoid using expireAfterSeconds: NaN as a configuration and correct this config anywhere it exists. Follow closely the upstream recommendations to detect affected indexes and modify them using the collMod command. SERVER-70879 - Corrected a potential race condition where multiple writing threads can update collection metadata in a way where overwrites could possibly happen. This could cause data/documents to be either unavailable or lost. SERVER-66289 - Fixed the issue with how the server handles batches of writes when running $out with secondary read preference by updating write size estimation logic in DocumentSourceWriter SERVER-61185 - Improved the performance of inserts into unique indexes SERVER-68115 - Prevented dropping empty path component from elemMatch path during index selection Find the full list of changes in the MongoDB 5.0.14 Community Edition release notes .

Time Series Collections are aimed at storing sequences of measurements over a period of time. These specialized collections will store data in a highly optimized way that will improve query efficiency, allow data analysis in real-time, and optimize disk usage. Resumable Index Builds means that the index build for a collection continues if a primary node in a replica set is switched to another server or when a server restarts. The build process is saved to disk and resumes from the saved position. This allows DBAs to perform maintenance and not worry about losing the index build in the process. Window operators allow operations on a specified span of documents known as window. $setWindowFields is a new pipeline stage to operate with these documents. Versioned API allows specifying which API version your application communicating with MongoDB runs against. Versioned API detaches the application\u2019s lifecycle from that of the database. As a result, you modify the application only to introduce new features instead of having to maintain compatibility with the new version of MongoDB.

This improvement allows users to comply with regulatory standards for data security. Other improvements and bug fixes introduced by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following: WT-8924 - Fixed a bug that causes replication to stall on secondary replica set members in a sharded cluster handling cross-shard transactions. It is caused by WiredTger to erroneously return a write conflict when deciding if an update to a record is allowed. If MongoDB decides to retry the operation that caused the conflict in WiredTiger, it will enter an indefinite retry loop, and oplog application will stall on secondary nodes. If this bug is hit, the secondary nodes will experience indefinite growth in replication lag. Restart the secondary nodes to resume replication. This bug affects MongoDB 4.4.10 through 4.4.13 and 5.0.4 to 5.0.7. Update to the latest version to avoid the secondary replication stall and lag issues.
