## Get the access token to the Pro repository

As a Percona Customer, you have the access to the ServiceNow portal. To request the access token, do the following:

1. In **ServiceNow**, click **My Account** and select **Entitlements**.
2. Select your entitlement.
3. If you are entitled for Pro builds, you will see the **Token Management** widget. Click the **Get Percona Builds Token** button.

    If you don't see the widget, contact Percona Support.

4. Click **Request Token** button in the **Request a Percona Pro Builds Token** dialog window.
5. A token will be generated for you. You will also see the Customer ID. Copy both the Customer ID and the token as you will use them to configure the Pro repository and install the software.
