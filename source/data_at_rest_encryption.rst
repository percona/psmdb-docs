Data at Rest Encryption
================================================================================

Data at rest encryption for the WiredTiger storage engine in |mongodb| was
introduced in |mongodb-enterprise| version 3.2. to ensure that encrypted data
files can be decrypted and read by parties with the decryption key.

.. rubric:: Differences from Upstream

The |feature| in |PSMDB| is introduced in version 3.6 to be compatible with
|feature| in |mongodb|. In the current release of |PSMDB|, the |feature| does
not include support for |abbr.kmip|, or |amazon-aws| key management
services.

.. rubric:: |vault| Integration

Starting from version 4.0, |PSMDB| provides |vault| integration.

.. admonition:: |vault| Parameters

.. list-table::
      :widths: auto
      :header-rows: 1

      * - command line
        - config file
        - Type
      * - vaultServerName
        - security.vault.ServerName
        - string
      * - vaultPort
        - security.vault.port
        - int
      * - vaultTokenFile
        - security.vault.secret
        - string
      * - vaultSecret
        - security.vault.secret
        - string
      * - vaultRotateMasterKey
        - security.vault.vaultrotateMasterKey
        - switch
      * - vaultServerCAFile
        - security.vault.serverCAFile
        - string
      * - vaultDisableTLSForTesting
        - security.vault.disableTLSForTesting
        - switch

The vault token file consists of the raw vault token and does not include any additional strings or parameters.

On start server tries to read the master key from the Vault. If the configured secret does not exist, Vault responds with HTTP 404 error. During the first run of the |PSMDB| the process generates a secure key and writes the key to the vault. 


.. rubric:: Encrypting Rollback Files

Starting from version 3.6, |PSMDB| also encrypts rollback files when data at
rest encryption is enabled. To inspect the contents of these files, use
|perconadecrypt|. This is a tool that you run from the command line as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ perconadecrypt --encryptionKeyFile FILE  --inputPath FILE --outputPath FILE [--encryptionCipherMode MODE]

When decrypting, the cipher mode must match the cipher mode which was used for
the encryption. By default, the |opt.encryption-cipher-mode| option uses the
|mode.cbc| mode.

.. admonition:: Parameters of |perconadecrypt|

   ========================  ==================================================================================
   Option                    Purpose
   ========================  ==================================================================================
   --encryptionKeyFile       The path to the encryption key file
   --encryptionCipherMode    The cipher mode for decryption. The supported values are |mode.cbc| or |mode.gcm|
   --inputPath               The path to the encrypted rollback file
   --outputPath              The path to save the decrypted rollback file
   ========================  ==================================================================================

.. rubric:: Important Configuration Options

|PSMDB| supports the ``encryptionCipherMode`` option where you choose one of the
following cipher modes:

- |mode.cbc|
- |mode.gcm|

By default, the |mode.cbc| cipher mode is applied. The following example
demonstrates how to apply the |mode.gcm| cipher mode when starting the
:program:`mongod` service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mongod ... --encryptionCipherMode AES256-GCM

.. seealso::

   |mongodb| Documentation: encryptionCipherMode Option
      https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-encryptionciphermode

|PSMDB| also supports the options exposed by the upstream solution:

- ``--enableEncryption`` to enable data at rest encryption
- ``--encryptionKeyFile`` to specify the path to a file that contains the encryption key

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mongod ... --enableEncryption --encryptionKeyFile <fileName>

The key file must contain a 32 character string encoded in base64. You can generate a random
key and save it to a file by using the |openssl| command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ openssl rand -base64 32 > mongodb-keyfile

Then, as the owner of the ``mongod`` process, update the file permissions: only
the owner should be able to read and modify this file. The effective permissions
specified with the ``chmod`` command can either be **600** (only the owner may
read and modify the file) or **400** (only the owner may read the file.)

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chmod 600 mongodb-keyfile

If ``mongod`` is started with the ``--relaxPermChecks`` option and the key file
is owned by ``root`` then ``mongod`` can read the file based on the
group bit set accordingly. The effective key file permissions in this
case are either **440** (both the owner and the group can only read the file) or
**640** (only the owner can read and the change the file, the group can only
read the file).

   |mongodb| Documentation: Configure Encryption
      https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-encryption/#local-key-management

All these options can be specified in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security:
      enableEncryption: <boolean>
      encryptionCipherMode: <string>
      encryptionKeyFile: <string>
      relaxPermChecks: <boolean>
