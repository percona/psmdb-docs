Data at Rest Encryption
================================================================================

Data at rest encryption for the WiredTiger storage engine in |mongodb| was
introduced in |mongodb-enterprise| version 3.2. to ensure that encrypted data
files can be decrypted and read by parties with the decryption key.

Note that data at rest encryption is enabled when starting |PSMDB| by providing
all essential encryption options. You cannot enable or disable encryption while
the |PSMDB| server is already running. Nor can you change the effective
encryption mode by simply restarting the server. Every time you restart the
server, the encryption settings must be the same.

.. rubric:: Differences from Upstream

The |feature| in |PSMDB| is introduced in version 3.6 (it was beta in 3.6.8-2.0
and GA in 3.6.10-3.0) to be compatible with |feature| in |mongodb|. In the
current release of |PSMDB|, the |feature| does not support |abbr.kmip|, or
|amazon-aws| key management services. Starting from version 3.6.13-3.3, |PSMDB|
provides |vault| integration (see the :ref:`psmdb.data-at-rest-encryption-vault`
section for more information).

Encrypting Rollback Files Using Encryption Key File
================================================================================

Starting from version 3.6.10-3.0, |PSMDB| enables encrypting rollback files when data at
rest encryption is enabled. To inspect the contents of these files, use
|perconadecrypt|. This is a tool that you run from the command line as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ perconadecrypt --encryptionKeyFile FILE  --inputPath FILE --outputPath FILE [--encryptionCipherMode MODE]

When decrypting, the cipher mode must match the cipher mode which was used for
the encryption. By default, the |opt.encryption-cipher-mode| option uses the
|mode.cbc| mode. The |opt.encryption-cipher-mode| option is applicable to both
keyfile and |vault| methods.

.. admonition:: Parameters of |perconadecrypt|

   ========================  ==================================================================================
   Option                    Purpose
   ========================  ==================================================================================
   --encryptionKeyFile       The path to the encryption key file
   --encryptionCipherMode    The cipher mode for decryption. The supported values are |mode.cbc| or |mode.gcm|
   --inputPath               The path to the encrypted rollback file
   --outputPath              The path to save the decrypted rollback file
   ========================  ==================================================================================

.. rubric:: Important Configuration Options When Using Key File Encryption

With encryption key files, |PSMDB| supports the ``encryptionCipherMode`` option
where you choose one of the following cipher modes:

- |mode.cbc|
- |mode.gcm|

By default, the |mode.cbc| cipher mode is applied. The following example
demonstrates how to apply the |mode.gcm| cipher mode when starting the
:program:`mongod` service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mongod ... --encryptionCipherMode AES256-GCM

.. seealso::

   |mongodb| Documentation: encryptionCipherMode Option
      https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-encryptionciphermode

|PSMDB| also supports the options exposed by the upstream solution: 

- ``--enableEncryption`` to enable data at rest encryption (applicable to both
  keyfile and |vault| methods)
- ``--encryptionKeyFile`` to specify the path to a file that contains the encryption key

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mongod ... --enableEncryption --encryptionKeyFile <fileName>
  
The key file must contain a 32 character string encoded in base64. You can generate a random
key and save it to a file by using the |openssl| command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ openssl rand -base64 32 > mongodb-keyfile

Then, as the owner of the ``mongod`` process, update the file permissions: only
the owner should be able to read and modify this file. The effective permissions
specified with the ``chmod`` command can either be **600** (only the owner may
read and modify the file) or **400** (only the owner may read the file.)

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chmod 600 mongodb-keyfile

If ``mongod`` is started with the ``--relaxPermChecks`` option and the key file
is owned by ``root`` then ``mongod`` can read the file based on the
group bit set accordingly. The effective key file permissions in this
case are either **440** (both the owner and the group can only read the file) or
**640** (only the owner can read and the change the file, the group can only
read the file).

.. seealso::

   |mongodb| Documentation: Configure Encryption
      https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-encryption/#local-key-management

All these options can be specified in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security:
      enableEncryption: <boolean>
      encryptionCipherMode: <string>
      encryptionKeyFile: <string>
      relaxPermChecks: <boolean>

HashiCorp Vault Integration
================================================================================

Starting from version 3.6.13-3.3, |PSMDB| provides |vault| integration. We only
support the |vault| backend with KV Secrets Engine - Version 2 (API)
with versioning enabled.

.. seealso::

   How to configure the KV Engine
      https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/kv/kv-v2.html

==========================  ====================================  ==========
Command Line	            Config File                           Type
==========================  ====================================  ==========
vaultServerName	            security.vault.ServerName	          string
vaultPort	            security.vault.port	                  int
vaultTokenFile	            security.vault.secret	          string
vaultSecret	            security.vault.secret	          string
vaultRotateMasterKey	    security.vault.vaultrotateMasterKey	  switch
vaultServerCAFile	    security.vault.serverCAFile	          string
vaultDisableTLSForTesting   security.vault.disableTLSForTesting	  switch
==========================  ====================================  ==========

The vault token file consists of the raw vault token and does not include any
additional strings or parameters.

On start, the server tries to read the master key from the Vault. If the
configured secret does not exist, Vault responds with the HTTP 404 error. During
the first run of |PSMDB|, the process generates a secure key and writes the key
to the vault.

Migrating from Key File Encryption to |vault| Encryption
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use either the |vault| integration feature or the key file
encryption. If you have used the key file encryption and wish to migrate to  
using |vault|, complete the following steps:

1. Insert the key from keyfile into the |vault| server to the desired secret
   path.
#. Stop mongod.
#. Add the startup options for |vault| integration for data at rest encryption.
#. Remove the startup options for the key file encryption.
#. Start the ``mongod`` service
