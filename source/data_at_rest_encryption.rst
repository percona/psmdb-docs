Data at Rest Encryption
================================================================================

Data at rest encryption for the WiredTiger storage engine in |mongodb| was
introduced in |mongodb-enterprise| version 3.2. to ensure that encrypted data
files can be decrypted and read by parties with the decryption key.

.. rubric:: Differences from Upstream

The |feature| in |PSMDB| is introduced in version 3.6. It uses the same options
as |feature| in |mongodb|. However, you cannot use data from
|mongodb-enterprise|. The |feature| does not include support for |abbr.kmip|,
|vault| or |amazon-aws| key management services.

.. important:: 

   This feature is considered **BETA** quality. Do not use the |feature| in a
   production environment.

.. rubric:: Important Configuration Options

|PSMDB| supports the ``encryptionCipherMode`` option where you choose one of the
following cipher modes:

- |mode.cbc|
- |mode.gcm|

By default, the |mode.cbc| cipher mode is applied. The following example
demonstrates how to apply the |mode.gcm| cipher mode when starting the
:program:`mongod` service:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mongod ... --encryptionCipherMode AES256-GCM

.. seealso::

   |mongodb| Documentation: encryptionCipherMode Option
      https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-encryptionciphermode

|PSMDB| also supports the options exposed by the upstream solution: 

- ``--enableEncryption`` to enable data at rest encryption
- ``--encryptionKeyFile`` to specify the path to a file that contains the encryption key

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mongod ... --enableEncryption --encryptionKeyFile <fileName>
  
The key file must contain a 32 character string encoded in base64. You can generate a random
key and save it to a file by using the |openssl| command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ openssl rand -base64 32 > mongodb-keyfile

Then, as the owner of the ``mongod`` process, update the file permissions: only
the owner should be able to read and modify this file:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chmod 600 mongodb-keyfile

.. seealso::

   |mongodb| Documentation: Configure Encryption
      https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-encryption/#local-key-management

All these options can be specified in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security:
      enableEncryption: <boolean>
      encryptionCipherMode: <string>
      encryptionKeyFile: <string>
