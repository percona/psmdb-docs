This starts |PSMDB| with the feature set of |prev-version| version. We recommend that you run the database in this state for some period to make sure that your applications are compatible with the new version of |PSMDB|.

Assuming that your applications are compatible with the new version, enable |version| version features. Run the following command against the ``admin`` database:

.. code-block:: text

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "5.0" } )
