Release Highlights
=============================

The changes and bug fixes introduced by MongoDB include the following:

* The ``libsasl2`` dependencies are added for DEB-based operating systems to enable GSSAPI and Kerberos authentication to work out-of-the box after installing MongoDB (`SERVER-54729 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-54729>`_)
* The number of modify updates in WiredTiger is now limited to prevent performance issues (`WT-7776 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-7776>`_)
* Errors related to proxy connections receive new error codes so that they don't change the behavior of clients' drivers (`SERVER-50549 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-50549>`_)
* Pre-warming of connection pools in `mongos` tier (`SERVER-44152 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-44152>`_)

Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-918`: Disable the ability to delete the ``mongod`` user in RPM packages during the re-installation of Percona Server for MongoDB. - This preserves the permissions to the MongoDB data directory for the ``mongod`` user since its user ID and group ID remain unchanged.



Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-873`: RPM packages now include the ``cyrus-sasl`` modules to enable LDAP authentication via native LDAP against Active Directory
