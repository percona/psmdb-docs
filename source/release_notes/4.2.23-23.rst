Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.23-23 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2.23 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 4.2.23 protocols and drivers.

Release Highlights
================================================================================

* :ref:`Data-at-rest encryption using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) <kmip>` is generally available enabling you to use it in your production environment
* :ref:`backup-cursor` functionality is generally available, enabling your application developers to use it for building custom backup solutions. 
  
  .. note::

     Percona provides `Percona Backup for MongoDB <https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/index.html>`_ - the open source tool for consistent backups and restores in MongoDB sharded clusters.

* Fixed security vulnerability `CVE-2022-3602 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-3602>`_ for |PSMDB| 4.2.21-21 and higher installed from tarballs on Ubuntu 22.04. 

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* `SERVER-68925 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68925>`_ - Detect and resolve table logging inconsistencies for WiredTiger tables at startup
* `SERVER-56127 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-56127>`_ - Fixed retryable writes on update and delete commands to not execute more than once if chunk is migrated and shard key pattern uses nested fields
* `SERVER-66310 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66310>`_ - Changed the `ExpressionSetUnion::isCommutative()` function to return false when a non-simple collation is in place for the `$setUnion` aggregation expression
