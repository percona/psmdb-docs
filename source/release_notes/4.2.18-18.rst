Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.18-18 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2.18 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 4.2.18 protocols and drivers.

Release Highlights
==================

The bug fixes and improvements, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* `SERVER-56227 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-56227>`_ - Added the `SetAllowMigrationsCommand` command that prevents the balancer to migrate chunks on shards.
* `SERVER-56226 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-56226>`_ Added a flag for the config server that prevents new migrations to start and ongoing migrations to commit.
* `SERVER-61427 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61427>`_ - Skip running duplicate key handler if the exact key already exists in the table. This fixes availability loss during the index build that was caused by checking many false duplicates.
* `SERVER-54064 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-54064>`_ Added periodic clean up of logical sessions cache on arbiters
