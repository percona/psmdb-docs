:Installation: `Installing Percona Server for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/5.0/install/index.html>`_

.. warning::

   We don't recommend this version for the production use due to the critical issue with sharding metadata inconsistency: `SERVER-68511 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68511>`_. The metadata inconsistency is observed when running the ``movePrimary`` command on the database that has the Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) set to 4.4 or earlier. Affects MongoDB versions 5.0.0 through 5.0.10 and MongoDB 6.0.0. Upgrade to the fixed version of MongoDB 5.0.11 / Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.11-10 as soon as possible.

   Please follow closely the upstream recommendations outlined in `SERVER-68511 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68511>`_ to work around this issue and for the remediation steps, if your cluster is affected.
   
Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.5-4 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0.5 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 5.0.5 protocols and drivers.

.. important::

   One of the main new features for MongoDB v5.0 is live `resharding <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharding-reshard-a-collection/#std-label-sharding-resharding>`_. Be aware that there have been multiple bugs related to this new feature through the releases to date (5.0.0 through 5.0.5). Please test thoroughly in your development and staging environments and use this feature on live production systems with caution.


Release Highlights
==================

The bug fixes and improvements, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* `SERVER-59858 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59858>`_ - Added histograms to track latency for tasks scheduled on the reactor thread.
* `SERVER-61483 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61483>`_  - Fixed an issue when resharding a collection that could cause data inconsistency (lost writes) due to incorrect actions by the ReshardingCoordinator and attempts to commit anyway. Also could cause fassert() to config server primary.
* `SERVER-61482 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61482>`_ - Fixed an issue with stalls on the config server. Updates to config server during resharding may wait too long for oplog slot thus stalling replication on config server indefinitely.
* `SERVER-61633 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61633>`_ Fixed a resharding issue relating to RecipientStateMachine that caused the server to crash
