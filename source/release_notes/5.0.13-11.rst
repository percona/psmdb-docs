================================================================================

:Date: October , 2022
:Installation: `Installing Percona Server for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/5.0/install/index.html>`_

Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.13-12 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for `MongoDB 5.0.13 <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.12---sep-05--2022>`_ and `MongoDB 5.0.13 Community Edition <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.13---sep-29--2022>`_.

It supports protocols and drivers of both MongoDB 5.0.12 and 5.0.13.

This release of |PSMDB| includes the improvements and bug fixes of MongoDB  Community Edition 5.0.12 and 5.0.13. 

Release Highlights
==================

* :ref:`Data at rest encryption using the KMIP protocol <kmip>` is now generally available, enabling you to use this functionality in production environments.
* `Percona Server for MongoDB Docker container <https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/percona-server-mongodb>`_ now includes the ``mongodb-tools`` utility set to align with the upstream container. This enables users to manage backup/restore operations of |PSMDB|.
* Updated exit code and status message during the master key rotation improves the user experience while using data-at-rest encryption with KMIP.

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* `SERVER-68925 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68925>`_ - Detect and resolve table logging inconsistencies for WiredTiger tables at startup
* `SERVER-60958 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60958>`_ - Prevent the server from hanging in chunk migration when a step-down occurs.
* `SERVER-65382 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-65382>`_ - Fixed the issue with incorrect chunk size comparison during split by preventing the `AutoSplitVector` from using the `clientReadable`.
* `SERVER-63843 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-63843>`_ - Fixed the logger deadlock by adding a check against recursive logging 
* `WT-9870 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-9870>`_ - Fixed the global time window state before performing the rollback to stable operation by updating the pinned timestamp as part of the transaction setup.
* `SERVER-69220 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-69220>`_ - Fixed the issue that could lead to data inconsistency by introducing the additional validation of field types for shard key patterns. Users should not modify the type (hashed or range) for the existing shard key fields 
* `SERVER-67650 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-67650>`_ - Fixed the issue with failing resharding operation by introducing the start and end time metrics for resharding recipient
* `SERVER-68094 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68094>`_ - Fixed the projection error during the resharding operation by using the ``$replaceRoot`` stage instead of the ``$project`` one
