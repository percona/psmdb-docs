Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-473`: The ``logApplicationMessage`` command failed even when
  it was run by the user with extended privileges. The problem has been fixed to
  allow running the ``logApplicationMessage`` command by any role that has the
  `applicationMessage` privilege, such as `clusterManager` or `hostManager`.
