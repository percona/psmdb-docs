:Installation: :ref:`install`

Percona announces the GA release of |PSMDB| |release| on |date|. Download the
latest version from the `Percona website`_ or the `Percona software repositories`_.

|PSMDB| is an enhanced, open source, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for |mongodb-ce|.  It supports |mongodb|
4.0 protocols and drivers.

|PSMDB| extends the functionality of the |mongodb-ce| by including the
:ref:`inmemory` storage engine, :ref:`encrypted WiredTiger storage engine
<psmdb.data-at-rest-encryption>`, :ref:`audit logging <audit-log>`, :ref:`SASL
authentication <ext-auth>`, :ref:`hot backups <hot-backup>`, and :ref:`enhanced
query profiling <rate-limit>`. |PSMDB| requires no changes to |mongodb|
applications or code.

Release |release| :ref:`extends the buildInfo command with the
psmdbVersion key <dochome>` to report the version of |PSMDB|. If this key
exists then |PSMDB| is installed on the server. This key is
not available from |mongodb|.

This release `includes all features
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0>`_ of |mongodb-ce|
4.0. Most notable among these are:

- `Multi-Document ACID transactions
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#multi-document-transactions>`_
- `Type conversion through the new aggregation operators
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#new-type-conversion-operators>`_
- `Enhancements to the Change Streams support
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#database-and-deployment-change-streams>`_

Note that the `MMAPv1 storage engine is deprecated
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#deprecate-mmapv1>`_
in |mongodb-ce| 4.0.

Improvements
================================================================================

- :psmdb-bug:`216`: The database command ``buildInfo`` provides the
  ``psmdbVersion`` key to report the version of |PSMDB|. If this key exists then
  |PSMDB| is installed on the server. This key is not available from |mongodb|.
