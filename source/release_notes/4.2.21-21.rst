Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.21-21 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2.21 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 4.2.21 protocols and drivers.

Release Highlights
==================

* Support of :ref:`multiple KMIP servers <kmip>` adds failover to your data-at-rest encryption setup.
* Allow users to set KMIP client certificate password through a flag to simplify the migration from MongoDB Enterprise to |PSMDB|. 
* |PSMDB| is now available on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).
  
Other improvements and bug fixes introduced by MongoDB and included in |PSMDB| are the following:

* `SERVER-58506 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-58506>`_ - Extend the ``getParameter`` command output with the information about a parameter to be enabled on runtime or only on startup
* `SERVER-62272 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-62272>`_ - Ensure that applying schema validation rules to a non-empty collection prevents chunk migration for the data that existed before these rules were applied.
* `SERVER-66176 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66176>`_ - Improve the ``CollectionCatalog`` workflow by making hashing before taking a lock and adding an API for restoring after yield.
* `SERVER-61097 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61097>`_ - Fixed the issue with cache eviction causing deadlocks by allowing a transaction to time itself out
