* :ref:`External SASL authentication <ext-auth>`
  using OpenLDAP or Active Directory

  to track and query database interactions of users or applications
* :ref:`hot-backup` for the default WiredTiger_
  and alternative :ref:`mongorocks` storage engine
* :ref:`rate-limit` to decrease the impact of the profiler on performance

Known Issues
------------

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-184` - MongoRocks reindexing collection or repairing database
  commands can cause inconsistency when doing immediate majority read in
  replica set.

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-185` - MongoDB has its own notion of time, including an
  expected commit order for transactions that may be inconsistent with the
  order assigned by MongoRocks.
  This can cause majority read inconsistencies in highly concurrent
  environments in replica set mode.
