Upgrading from |PSMDB| |prev-version| to |version|
================================================================================

:Availability: MongoRocks has been removed from |PSMDB| |version|

To upgrade |PSMDB| to version |version|, you must be running version
|prev-version|. Upgrades from earlier versions are not supported.

Before upgrading your production |PSMDB| deployments, test all your applications
in a testing environment to make sure they are compatible with the new version. For more information, see `Compatibility Changes in MongoDB 4.0 <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0-compatibility/>`_
	

The general procedure for performing an in-place upgrade (where your existing
data and configuration files are preserved) includes the following steps:

1. Stop the :program:`mongod` instance
#. Enable |percona| repository for new version
#. Install new packages. Old packages are automatically considered obsolete 	and removed
#. Start the :program:`mongod` instance

It is recommended to upgrade |PSMDB| from official Percona repositories using
the corresponding package manager for your system.  For more information, see
:ref:`install`.

.. warning::

   Perform a full backup of your data and configuration files before upgrading.
