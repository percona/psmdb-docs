    **Changes to Chunk Management and Balancing**

    Several changes have been incrementally introduced within 6.0.x releases.

    * The name of a subset of data has changed from a `chunk` to a `range`. 
    * The data size has changed from 64 MB for a chunk to 128 MB for a range.

    * The balancer now distributes ranges based on the actual data size of collections. Formerly the balancer migrated and balanced data across shards based strictly on the number of chunks of data that exist for a collection across each shard. This, combined with the auto-splitter process could cause quite a heavy performance impact to heavy write environments. 

    * Ranges (formerly chunks) are no longer auto-split. They are split only when they move across shards for distribution purposes. The auto-splitter process is currently still available but it serves no purpose and does nothing active to the data. This also means that the Enable/Disable AutoSplit helpers should no longer be used. 

    The above changes are expected to lead to better performance overall going forward.
