# FIPS compliance

FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) is the US government computer security standard for cryptography modules that include both hardware and software components. Percona Server for MongoDB supports FIPS certified module for OpenSSL, enabling US organizations to introduce FIPS-compliant encryption and thus meet the requirements towards data security.  

The FIPS module, available in Percona Server for MongoDB is implemented in the same way, as in MongoDB Enterprise. See [Configure MongoDB for FIPS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/tutorial/configure-fips/) in MongoDB documentation for configuration guidelines.
