Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.18-15 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for [MongoDB 5.0.18 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.18---may-18--2023).

It supports MongoDB 5.0.18 protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [WT-10551](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-10551) - Fixed the bug with WiredTiger failing to load the incremental backup change bitmap for a file. The issue affects MongoDB versions 4.4.8 through 4.4.21, 5.0.2 through 5.0.17, and 6.0.0 through 6.0.5 causing the server to crash with the checksum error if the affected incremental backup was restored and the affected data is accessed.

    If you are using incremental backups, upgrade to the fixed upstream version 5.0.18 / Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.18-15 as soon as possible. Follow closely the upstream recommendations to remediate the negative impact.  

* [SERVER-48196](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-48196) - Updated the built-in timezone files the latest version by upgrading the timezone library
* [SERVER-54150](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-54150) - Improved the oplog application behavior to finish without issues during a recovery from a stable checkpoint
* [SERVER-57056](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-57056) - Fixed the syslog severity level for INFO messages 
* [SERVER-72686](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72686) - Added support for `$collStats` aggregation stage on timeseries collections
