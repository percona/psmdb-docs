# Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.4-2 (2023-12-11) 

[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}

We are pleased to announce the general availability of Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.4-2 â€“ the drop in replacement for MongoDB Community Edition. Percona Server for MongoDB supports MongoDB community protocols and drivers and enhances it with the [enterprise-grade features for free](../comparison.md), enabling you to effectively meet the requirements of your organization in terms of high-availability, reliability and data security. 

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.4-2 includes the improvements and bug fixes of [MongoDB 7.0.3 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0/#7.0.3---nov-9--2023) and [MongoDB 7.0.4 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0/#7.0.4---nov-13--2023).

It supports protocols and drivers of both MongoDB 7.0.3 and MongoDB 7.0.4.

## Upgrade considerations

* Starting with version 7.0, Percona Server for MongoDB enables journaling by default. Both the `storage.journal.enabled` configuration option and the corresponding `--journal`, `--no-journal` command-line options are now ignored. You receive the corresponding warning during the server start after the upgrade. To get rid of this warning, change your configuration to remove the journaling options. See the [upgrade guide](../install/upgrade-from-60.md) for exact procedure.

* Starting with version 7.0:

    - Binary downgrades **are no longer supported**. See the [list of backward-incompatible features](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0-compatibility/#backward-incompatible-features)
    - After you have upgraded the database, allow your deployment to run without setting [setFeatureCompatibilityVersion](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#mongodb-dbcommand-dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) to 7.0 for a burn-in period to ensure the likelihood of downgrade is minimal. When you are confident that the likelihood of downgrade is minimal, enable these features.
    - The [setFeatureCompatibilityVersion](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#mongodb-dbcommand-dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) command requires an additional parameter, `confirm`. You must set it to `true` to upgrade or downgrade fCV.

* Due to [time series sharded cluster operation routing issue](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80203) occurred in MongoDB version 7.0.1 - 7.0.3 and fixed in version 7.0.4, follow closely the upstream remediation recommendations to identify and recover orphanated collections.

## Release Highlights

* You can now configure the retry behavior for Percona Server for MongoDB to connect to the KMIP server when using [data-at-rest encryption](../kmip.md). 
* Percona Server for MongoDB now includes telemetry that fills in the gaps in our understanding of how you use Percona Server for MongoDB to improve our products. Participation in the anonymous program is optional. You can opt-out if you prefer not to share this information. [Read more about Telemetry](../telemetry.md).  

Improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following:

* [SERVER-80203](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80203) - Fixed the routing issue with sharded time series collections which could result in metadata inconsistency. The issue occurred when the documents that have the shard key containing the embedded object composed of multiple fields are routed to an incorrect shard and become orphanated. As a result orphanated documents may not be returned when queried through the mongos and/or may be deleted. The issue affects time series sharded collections starting in MongoDB version 5.0.6 through versions 5.0.21, 6.0.11 and 7.0.2. 

   If you are using time series collections, upgrade to MongoDB 7.0.4 or Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.4-2 as soon as possible. Please follow closely the upstream recommendations to identify and preserve orphanated documents. 

* [SERVER-67962](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-67962) - Fixed the order of execution of data inserts/updates and deletes into `config.image_collection` 
* [SERVER-69244](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-69244) - Fixed the behaviour of the `$merge` aggregation stage on sharded clusters when the default read concern has been set to "majority"
* [SERVER-79975](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-79975) - Optimized large group keys by adding the document shredder stage
* [SERVER-81133](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81133) - Speeded up the logic that persist routing table cache
* [SERVER-82446](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-82446) - Fixed the $densify stage processing where documents are generated outside of range
* [SERVER-77506](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-77506) - Fixed the issue with the data and the ShardVersion mismatch for sharded multi-document transactions by adding the check that no chunk has moved for the collection being referenced since transaction started
* [SERVER-79088](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-79088) - Improves the slot-based execution engine (SBE) multi-planner performance for query which returns zero results
* [SERVER-81106](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81106) - Improved the recipient shard behavior during the chunk migration to wait for changes to catalog cache to be persisted before the cloning phase.
* [SERVER-81966](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81966) - Fixed the issue that caused the modification of the original ChunkMap vector during the chunk migration and that could lead to data loss. The issue affects MongoDB versions 4.4.25, 5.0.21, 6.0.10 through 6.0.11 and 7.0.1 through 7.0.2. Requires stopping all chunk merge activities and restarting all the binaries in the cluster (both `mongod` and `mongos`). 
* [WT-11564](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-11564) - Fixed the rollback-to-stable behavior to read the newest transaction value only when it exists in the checkpoint.
