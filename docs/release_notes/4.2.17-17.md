## Improvements


* [PSMDB-918](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PSMDB-918): Disable the ability to delete the `mongod` user in RPM packages during the re-installation of Percona Server for MongoDB. - This preserves the permissions to the MongoDB data directory for the `mongod` user since its user ID and group ID remain unchanged.

## Bugs Fixed


* [PSMDB-873](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PSMDB-873): RPM packages now include the `cyrus-sasl` modules to enable LDAP authentication via native LDAP against Active Directory
