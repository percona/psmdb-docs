The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-40459](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-40459) - Optimized the construction of the balancer's collection distribution status histogram

* [SERVER-68434](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68434) - Fixed the query planner logic to distinguish parameterized queries in the presence of a partial index that contains logical expressions (`$and`, `$or`).

* [SERVER-71627](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-71627) - Improved performance of updating the routing table and prevented blocking client requests during refresh for clusters with 1 million of chunks.

* [SERVER-80488](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80488) - Avoided traversing routing table in balancer split chunk policy

* [SERVER-81966](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81966) - Fixed the issue that caused the modification of the original ChunkMap vector during the chunk migration and that could lead to data loss. The issue affects MongoDB versions 4.4.25, 5.0.21, 6.0.10 through 6.0.11 and 7.0.1 through 7.0.2. Requires stopping all chunk merge activities and restarting all the binaries in the cluster (both `mongod` and `mongos`).
