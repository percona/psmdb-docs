The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-68548](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68548) - Fixed the behavior of the `quiet` global server parameter for logging.
* [SERVER-80021](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80021) - Fixed the conversion form string to doubleValue to not lose precision and be able to rountrip and retrieve the same value back.
* [SERVER-80703](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80703) - Improved chunk migration logic by avoiding traversing routing table in the migration destination manager.
* [SERVER-81106](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81106) - Improved the recipient shard behavior during the chunk migration to wait for changes to catalog cache to be persisted before the cloning phase.
