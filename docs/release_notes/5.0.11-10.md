It supports MongoDB 5.0.11 protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

* [SERVER-68511](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68511) - Fixed the issue that caused inconsistency in sharding metadata when running the `movePrimary` command on the database that has the Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) set to 4.4 or earlier. Affects MongoDB versions 5.0.0 through 5.0.10 and MongoDB 6.0.0. Upgrade to the the fixed version of MongoDB 5.0.11 / Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.11-10 as soon as possible.

* [SERVER-61321](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61321), [SERVER-60607](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60607) - Improved handling of large/NaN (Not a Number) values for text index and geo index version.

* [SERVER-68628](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68628) - Prevented potential server crash or lost writes when a resharding retry happens after the primary node failover. This is fixed by refreshing the routing information on the primary node during resharding.

* [WT-9500](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-9500) - Prevent rollback to stable operation to generate wrong updates/tombstones by always reading the cell time window information to decide the history store update visibility.

* [WT-9004](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-9004) - Fixed memory leak in update restore eviction.

* [SERVER-67492](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-67492) - Failed chunk migrations can lead to recipient shard having different config.transactions records between primaries and secondaries - inconsistent data.

* [SERVER-68495](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68495) - Fixed the issue when resharding a collection with a very large number of zones configured may have stalled on config server primary indefinitely.

* [SERVER-68628](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68628) - Fixed the issue when retrying a failed resharding operation after a primary failover could lead to server crash or lost writes.

* [SERVER-68193](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68193) - Prevented sharding DDL coordinator to lock itself out in distlock retry loop.
