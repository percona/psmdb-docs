[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}


Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.9-7 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 6.0.9 Community Edition.

It is based on [MongoDB 6.0.9 Community edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/release-notes/6.0/#6.0.9---aug-14--2023) and supports the upstream protocols and drivers.

!!! warning

    We don't recommend this version for production use due to the issue with routing sharding time series collections [SERVER-80203](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80203) which could result in metadata inconsistency. The routing issue is observed when documents have the shard key containing the embedded object composed of multiple fields. 

    The issue affects time series sharded collections starting in MongoDB version 5.0.6 through versions 5.0.21, 6.0.11 and 7.0.2. It is fixed upstream in versions 5.0.22, 6.0.12 and 7.0.4 and included in Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.22-19, 6.0.12-9 and 7.0.4-2.

    If you are using time series collections, upgrade to the fixed version of MongoDB / Percona Server for MongoDB as soon as possible and follow closely the upstream recommendations outlined in [SERVER-80203](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80203) for remediation steps.
