# Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.0-1 (2019-09-09) 

We are pleased to announce the launch of Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.0-1 on September 9, 2019. Our
engineers have been hard at work to bring this to you less than a month after
the launch of MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition 4.2.

Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.0-1 includes all of the new features of the latest version of
MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition, as well as providing our users with Enterprise-level [enhancements](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/feature-comparison) for free.

Download the latest version from the [Percona website](https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-4.2/) or the [Percona software
repositories](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/4.2/install/index.html).

Percona Server for MongoDB is an enhanced, source available, and highly-scalable database that acts as a fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition. It supports MongoDB 4.2 protocols and drivers.

Percona Server for MongoDB extends the functionality of the MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition by including the [Percona Memory Engine](../inmemory.md#inmemory) storage engine, [encrypted WiredTiger storage engine](../data-at-rest-encryption.md#psmdb-data-at-rest-encryption), [audit logging](../audit-logging.md#audit-log),
[external LDAP Authentication](../authentication.md#ext-auth), [hot backups](../hot-backup.md#hot-backup),
and [enhanced query profiling](../rate-limit.md#rate-limit). Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to
MongoDB applications or code.

Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.0-1 includes all of the features of MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition. The most notable among these are:

* [Distributed transactions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/#distributed-transactions)
(or Multi-Document Transactions) to enable transactions on sharded clusters
and replica sets removing the transaction total size limit.

* [Wildcard indexes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-wildcard/index.html) to have indexes span sets of unknown or arbitrary fields.

Improving its security, MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition resolves the following CVEs: [CVE-2019-2389](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-40563) and [CVE-2019-2386](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-38984).

MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition [removes the MMAPv1 storage engine along with MMAPv1 specific configuration options, parameters and commands](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/#removed-mmapv1-storage-engine). It also [removes a number of commands and methods not related to MMAPv1](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/#removed-commands-and-methods).

Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.0-1 is based on [MongoDB 4.2.0](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2).

There are a number of benefits in downloading the latest version of our
software, including the impressive new features referenced above, which make it
easier to run and manage your MongoDB database and help to keep your data safe.

We believe that MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition is a great improvement on previous versions, with
some long-awaited enhancements, including features which were previously only
available in the Enterprise version.

Percona Server for MongoDB is a free and open source drop-in for MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition and includes all of
the new features of 4.2, and more! This makes it an attractive proposition for
businesses looking to have a robust database software solution in place and make
the most of their IT budget.
