# Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.14-11 (2024-03-26)

[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}


Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.14-11 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB Community Edition 6.0.14

It is based on [MongoDB 6.0.14 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0/#6.0.14---feb-28--2024) and supports the upstream protocols and drivers.

!!! warning

    Due to [CVE-2024-1351](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1351), in all MongoDB versions prior to 4.4.29, the `mongod` server allows incoming connections to skip peer certificate validation which results in untrusted connections to succeed. This issue occurs when the `mongod` is started with TLS enabled (`net.tls.mode` set to `allowTLS`, `preferTLS`, or `requireTLS`) and without a `net.tls.CAFile` configured. For details, see [SERVER-72839](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72839).

    The issue is fixed upstream in versions 4.4.29, 5.0.25, 6.0.14 and 7.0.6 and in Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.29-28, 5.0.25-22, 6.0.14-11 and 7.0.7-4. Now, configuring MongoDB to use TLS requires specifying the value for the `--tlsCAFile` flag, the `net.tls.CAFile `configuration option, or the `tlsUseSystemCA` parameter.

    If you are using TLS in your deployment, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to the latest versions of Percona Server for MongoDB.
