# Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.2-3 (2019-12-24)

We are pleased to announce the launch of Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.2-3 on December 24, 2019.

Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.2-3 includes all of the new features of the latest version of
MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition, as well as providing our users with Enterprise-level [enhancements](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/feature-comparison) for
free.

Download the latest version from the [Percona website](https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-4.2/) or the [Percona software
repositories](../install/index.md).

Percona Server for MongoDB is an enhanced, open source, and highly-scalable database that acts as a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition. It supports MongoDB
4.2 protocols and drivers.

Percona Server for MongoDB extends the functionality of the MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition by including the
[Percona Memory Engine](../inmemory.md) storage engine, [encrypted WiredTiger storage engine](../data-at-rest-encryption.md), [audit logging](../audit-logging.md),
[external LDAP Authentication](../authentication.md), [hot backups](../hot-backup.md),
and [enhanced query profiling](../rate-limit.md). Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.2-3 includes all of the features of MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition. The most notable among these are:

* [Distributed transactions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/#distributed-transactions)
(or Multi-Document Transactions) to enable transactions on sharded clusters
and replica sets removing the transaction total size limit.

* [Wildcard indexes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-wildcard/index.html) to have
indexes span sets of unknown or arbitrary fields.

MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition [removes the MMAPv1 storage engine along with MMAPv1 specific
configuration options, parameters and commands](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/#removed-mmapv1-storage-engine). It
also [removes a number of commands and methods not related to MMAPv1](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/#removed-commands-and-methods).

Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.2-3 is based on [MongoDB 4.2.2](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/#dec-9-2019).

## Bugs Fixed


* [473](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PSMDB-473): The `logApplicationMessage` command failed even when it
was run by the user with extended privileges. The problem has been fixed to
allow running the `logApplicationMessage` command by any role that has the
applicationMessage privilege, such as clusterManager or hostManager.

```javascript
> db.runCommand({logApplicationMessage: 'find'});
```
