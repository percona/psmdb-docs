## Release Highlights

### Upstream Improvements

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-59831](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59831) -  Improved inserting unique index keys behavior by preventing an oplog application to check for duplicates on unique indexes except for when building an index and inserting into the `_id` index. 

* [SERVER-76777](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-76777) - Fixed the deadlock between external abort and internal abort on index build.

* [SERVER-88750](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-88750) - Provided a way for external tools to insert/update/upsert documents without triggering the "replace Timestamp(0,0) with current time" behavior by adding the "bypassEmptyTsReplacement" parameter to those operations.

* [WT-8771](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-8771) - Avoid marking the page dirty for empty pages to prevent unnecessary page reconsiliation.
