[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.8-5 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB Community Edition 7.0.8.

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.8-5 is based on [MongoDB 7.0.8 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0/#7.0.8---april-3--2024) and supports the upstream protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

A number of issues with sharded multi-document transactions in sharded clusters of 2 or more shards have been identified that result in returning incorrect results and missing reads and writes. The issues occur when the transactionsâ€™ metadata is being concurrently modified by using the following operations: `moveChunk`, `moveRange`, `movePrimary`, `renameCollection`, `drop`, and `reshardCollection`. 

The data is affected when using the following functionalities:

* Sharded multi-document transactions
* Queryable encryption

The issues are fully fixed in MongoDB  4.4.29, 5.0.25, 6.0.14, 7.0.8, and are included in Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.29-28, 5.0.26-22,6.0.14-11 and 7.0.8-5. If you are using sharded multi-document transactions or queryable encryption, upgrade to Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.8-5 as soon as possible. Please follow closely the upstream recommendations for mitigation and remediation outlined in [Sharded multi-document transactions may perform operations using inconsistent sharding metadata](https://www.mongodb.com/alerts/critical-alert-sharding-txn-issues-apr-2024) alert.

Improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following:

* [SERVER-86583](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-86583) - Fixed the issue with reads returning incomplete results and mismatched sharding metadata when performed on sharded collections with the `readConcern: snapshot` and an `atClusterTime` values. The issue occurs if the following conditions apply to collections:

    * a collection is sharded at either the time of the read or at the atClusterTime.
    * a collection is dropped after the time atClusterTime
    * a collection is recreated as non-sharded after being dropped.

     The issue affects MongoDB versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.7. It is fixed upstream in 7.0.8 and is included in Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.8-5. Follow the upstream recommendations for workaround and remediation.

* [SERVER-78556](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-78556) - Fixed the issue with the replication lag by changing the `internalInsertMaxBatchSize` default value to 64
* [SERVER-79575](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-79575) - Fixed NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) nodes counting
* [SERVER-87666](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-87666) - Ensured that query shape for `$documents` stage in an aggregation pipeline is unique on each execution.
