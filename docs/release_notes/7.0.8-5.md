[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.8-5 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB Community Edition 7.0.8.

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.8-5 is based on [MongoDB 7.0.8 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0/#7.0.8---april-3--2024) and supports the upstream protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

Improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following:

* [SERVER-86583](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-86583) - Fixed the issue with reads returning incomplete results and mismatched sharding metadata when performed on sharded collections with the `readConcern: snapshot` and an `atClusterTime` values. The issue occurs if the following conditions apply to collections:

    * a collection is sharded at either the time of the read or at the atClusterTime.
    * a collection is dropped after the time atClusterTime
    * a collection is recreated as non-sharded after being dropped.

     The issue affects MongoDB versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.7. It is fixed upstream in 7.0.8 and is included in Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.8-5.

     If you use sharded collections, upgrade to version 7.0.8 as soon as possible. Consider avoiding depending on readConcern: snapshot with atClusterTime values during operational activities of dropping shraded collections and recreating them as non-sharded.

* [SERVER-78556](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-78556) - Fixed the issue with the replication lag by changing the `internalInsertMaxBatchSize` default value to 64
* [SERVER-79575](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-79575) - Fixed NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) nodes counting
* [SERVER-87666](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-87666) - Ensured that query shape for `$documents` stage in an aggregation pipeline is unique on each execution.
