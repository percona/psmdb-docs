Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.20-20 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2.20 Community Edition.

## Release Highlights

*Percona Server for MongoDB* now supports the master key rotation for data encrypted using the  [Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)](../kmip.md#kmip) protocol (tech preview feature). This improvement allows users to comply with regulatory standards for data security.

Other improvements and bug fixes introduced by MongoDB and included in *Percona Server for MongoDB* are the following:


* [SERVER-64983](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-64983) -  Abort the WiredTiger transaction after releasing Client lock to avoid deadlocks


* [SERVER-60412](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60412) - Check if the host has `cgroups` v2 enabled and read the memory limits according to that.


* [SERVER-64642](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-64642) - Return the shutdown error as the top level error when batch writing command fails due to mongos shutdown.


* [SERVER-59435](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59435) - Fixed the double free state for the `DocumentSource::optimizeAt()` pipeline by making sure all pointers are in place before disposing the pipeline prefix
