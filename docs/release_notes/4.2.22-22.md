Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.22-22 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2.22 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 4.2.22 protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

The changes and bug fixes introduced by MongoDB include the following:


* [SERVER-64403](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-64403) - Fixed an issue that occurred during the attempt to perform the collation-encoding of a document with a missing sort attribute. In this case an invariant is violated and `mongod` crashes.


* [SERVER-68359](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68359) - Fixed the TTLMonitor behavior to skip processing TTL indexes if the expireAfterSeconds option value is NaN (Not a Number).


* [SERVER-62656](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-62656) - Changed the behavior of the ShardingTaskExecutorPoolSize parameter to control the connection pool size for config server replica set and shard nodes separately.


* [SERVER-66418](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66418) - Fixed the issue with bad projection created during dependency analysis due to string order assumption. It resulted in the `PathCollision` error. The issue is fixed by improving dependency analysis for projections by folding dependencies into ancestor dependencies where possible.
