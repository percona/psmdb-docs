Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.14-12 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for [MongoDB 5.0.14 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.14---nov-21--2022).

It supports MongoDB 5.0.14 protocols and drivers 

## Release Highlights

With this release, :ref:`backup-cursor` is now generally available, enabling you to use it for building custom backup solutions.

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-68477](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68477) - Fixed the bug where an unexpected behavior could negatively impact existing TTL indexes with improper configuration and could cause the sudden expiration of TTL-indexed documents in a collection. This sudden expiration could cause data to be aged out prior than planned and could negatively impact write performance.

    This bug involves TTL indexes with the ``expireAfterSeconds`` value of NaN (not-a-number). The TTL indexes are treated as 0 instead of NaN and that resulted in the sudden expiration of TTL-indexed documents in a collection. The bug affects MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.13 and MongoDB 6.0.0 through 6.0.1.

    It could be hit on MongoDB 4.4/4.2 when initially syncing from a 5.0.0-5.0.13 or 6.0.0-6.0.1 node and on MongoDB 5.0.0-5.0.13 when restoring from a ``mongodump`` of 4.2 / 4.4 collection or initially syncing from a 4.2/4.4 node that has a TTL configured with expireAfterSeconds: NaN.

    The issue is fixed upstream in version 5.0.14 and 6.0.2. As the general recommendation, avoid using expireAfterSeconds: NaN as a configuration and correct this config anywhere it exists.
  
    Follow closely the upstream recommendations to detect affected indexes and modify them using the collMod command.

* [SERVER-70879](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-70879) - Corrected a potential race condition where multiple writing threads can update collection metadata in a way where overwrites could possibly happen. This could cause data/documents to be either unavailable or lost.
* [SERVER-66289](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66289) - Fixed the issue with how the server handles batches of writes when running $out with secondary read preference by updating write size estimation logic in ``DocumentSourceWriter``
* [SERVER-61185](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61185) -  Improved the performance of inserts into unique indexes
* [SERVER-68115](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68115) - Prevented dropping empty path component from `elemMatch` path during index selection
