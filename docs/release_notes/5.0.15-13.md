Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.15-13 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for [MongoDB 5.0.15 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.15---feb-27--2023).

It supports MongoDB 5.0.15 protocols and drivers 

!!! warning

    Due to critical issues identified in previous releases that may affect data integrity and performance, we recommend upgrading all production environments to the latest version - currently MongoDB 5.0.15. Find details about those issues in [MongoDB 5.0 Community Edition release notes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/).

## Release Highlights

* The support for authentication using [AWS IAM](../aws-iam.md) enables you to natively integrate Percona Server for MongoDB with AWS services, increase security of your infrastructure by setting up password-less authentication and offload your DBAs from managing different sets of secrets. This is the [technical preview feature](../glossary.md#technical-preview-feature)
* Improved master key rotation for data at rest encrypted with HashiCorp Vault enables you to use the same secret key path on every server in your entire deployment thus significantly simplifying the secrets management and key rotation process.
