# Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.14-8 ({{date.7_0_14}})

[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.14-8 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB Community Edition 7.0.12.

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.14-8 includes the improvements and bug fixes of [MongoDB 7.0.14 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0/#7.0.14---) and supports its protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

This release of Percona Server for MongoDB includes the following features and improvements:

### Enhanced Telemetry for better product usage reporting

The enhanced telemetry feature provides comprehensive information about how it works, its components and metrics as well as updated methods how to disable telemetry. Read more in [Telemetry on Percona Server for MongoDB](../telemetry.md)

### Reduce mean time to resolve (MTTR) compromised encryption key incidents in KMIP

Starting with this release, Percona Server for MongoDB automatically activates all new master encryption keys at startup and periodically checks (polls) their status in a KMIP server. If a master encryption key for a node transitions to the state other than Active, the node reports an error and shuts down. This method allows security engineers to quickly identify which nodes require out-of-schedule master key rotation, such as in the case of compromised keys, without needing to rotate keys for the entire cluster. 

Learn more about key state polling from [the documentation](../kmip.md#key-state-polling) 

### Easier dependency management with thinner tarballs 

Tarballs are now available for each supported operating system individually and no longer include built-in libraries. This change reduces the tarball download size and increases their security by simplifying updates for required dependencies. 

### Boost performance during cluster restore and scaling with file copy based initial sync

You can now select how a newly added or a restored node of your cluster receives the data from other members - via logical or file copy based sync. This sync method is faster than the logical one as it is the copying of physical files rather than data clone. 

This functionality is available in Pro builds of Percona Server for MongoDB. 

## Upstream Improvements

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-82814](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-82814) - Added support of internal expr comparison operators when determining clustered collection scan bounds
* [SERVER-85892](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-85892) - Fixed the error in the `$merge` operation produced by the pipeline after the `$documents` stage by correcting the namespace for pipeline validation
* [SERVER-91195](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91195) - Provided a generic backportable solution not to miss top-level timeseries collection options
* [SERVER-91625](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91625) - Enabled indexed plans for expressions referencing system variables by updating the fallback mechanism to disable SBE (Slot-Based Execution Engine) when a system variable is referenced in an expression.
* [WT-12643](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-12643) - Fixed Eviction Server walk logic in WiredTiger so that it's able to evict all pages
