| **Release date** | June 20, 2022 |
|----------------- | ---------------- | 
| **Installation** | [Installing Percona Server for MongoDB](../install/index.md)|

Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.9-8 is an enhanced, source available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0.9 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 5.0.9 protocols and drivers.

!!! warning 

    We don’t recommend this version for the production use due to the critical issue with sharding metadata inconsistency: [SERVER-68511](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68511). The metadata inconsistency is observed when running the `movePrimary` command on the database that has the Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) set to 4.4 or earlier. Affects MongoDB versions 5.0.0 through 5.0.10 and MongoDB 6.0.0. Upgrade to the fixed version of MongoDB 5.0.11 / Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.11-10 as soon as possible.

    Please follow closely the upstream recommendations outlined in [SERVER-68511](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68511) to work around this issue and for the remediation steps, if your cluster is affected.

## Release Highlights


* Support of [multiple KMIP servers](../kmip.md#kmip) adds failover to your data-at-rest encryption setup.

* Allow users to set KMIP client certificate password through a flag to simplify the migration from MongoDB Enterprise to Percona Server for MongoDB.

* Percona Server for MongoDB is now available on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).

* Improvements to initial syncs from a secondary sync source.

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:


* [SERVER-65137](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-65137) - Detect namespace changes when refreshing Collection after yielding to maintain data consistency and avoid stale catalogs.


* [SERVER-64822](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-64822) - Fixed the issue with releasing the critical state too early when sharding an empty collection. This could result in unwanted writes to that collection.


* [WT-9096](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-9096) - Fixed the wrong key/value returning during search near when the key doesn’t exist


* [SERVER-66041](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66041) - Prevented shard imbalances due to chunk cloner disregarding oversized chunks that contain only 1 oversized document
