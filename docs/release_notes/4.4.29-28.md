# Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.29-28 (2024-04-02)

[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}

Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.29-28 is a source available, highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.4.29 Community Edition enhanced [with enterprise-grade features](../comparison.md).

It supports protocols and drivers of MongoDB 4.4.29.

!!! warning

    Due to [CVE-2024-1351](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1351), in all MongoDB versions prior to 4.4.29, the `mongod` server allows incoming connections to skip peer certificate validation which results in untrusted connections to succeed. This issue occurs when the `mongod` is started with TLS enabled (`net.tls.mode` set to `allowTLS`, `preferTLS`, or `requireTLS`) and without a `net.tls.CAFile` configured. For details, see [SERVER-72839](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72839).

    The issue is fixed upstream in versions 4.4.29, 5.0.25, 6.0.14 and 7.0.6 and in Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.29-28, 5.0.25-22, 6.0.14-11 and 7.0.7-4. Now, configuring MongoDB to use TLS requires specifying the value for the `--tlsCAFile` flag, the `net.tls.CAFile `configuration option, or the `tlsUseSystemCA` parameter.
