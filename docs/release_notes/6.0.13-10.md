Improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following:

* [SERVER-33494](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-33494) - Removed size storer entries upon collection drop
* [SERVER-50792](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-50792) - Improved shard key index error messages by adding detailed information about an invalid index.
* [SERVER-70155](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-70155) - Improved slow query logging by adding the duration between a write operation getting a commit timestamp and actually committing. This helps identify issues where operations are committing slowly and are slowing down replication.
* [SERVER-77506](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-77506) - Fixed the issue with data and ShardVersion mismatch on sharded multi-document transactions by exposing the maxValidAfter timestamp alongside the shardVersion
* [SERVER-83091](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-83091) - Fixed the issue with infinite loop during plan enumeration triggered by the `$or` queries
