# Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.17-14 ({{date.6_0_17}})

[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}


Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.17-14 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB Community Edition 6.0.17. 

It is based on [MongoDB 6.0.17 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0/#6.0.17---aug-21--2024) and supports the upstream protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

### Reduce mean time to resolve (MTTR) compromised encryption key incidents in KMIP

Starting with this release, Percona Server for MongoDB automatically activates all new master encryption keys at startup and periodically checks (polls) their status in a KMIP server. If a master encryption key for a node transitions to the state other than Active, the node reports an error and shuts down. This method allows security engineers to quickly identify which nodes require out-of-schedule master key rotation, such as in the case of compromised keys, without needing to rotate keys for the entire cluster. 

Learn more about key state polling from [the documentation](../kmip.md#key-state-polling)  

### Upstream Improvements 

Improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following:

* [SERVER-85892](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-85892) - Fixed the error in the `$merge` operation produced by the pipeline after the `$documents` stage by correcting the namespace for pipeline validation
* [SERVER-91195](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91195) - Provided a generic backportable solution not to miss top-level timeseries collection options
* [SERVER-91362](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91362) - Fixed performance issues by not copying a JavaScript “scope” object if a cached JsExecution object already exists in a query thread
* [SERVER-91406](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91406) - Allowed the `$match` aggregation stage to move ahead of mongoS change stream stages
* [WT-12708](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-12708) - Fixed the issue with ineffective queuing of the pages by the eviction server in WoredTiger by introducing retries to find the ref in memory and thus avoiding returning NULL from the random descent function.
