Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.19-19 is a source available, highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.4.19 Community Edition enhanced [with enterprise-grade features](../comparison.md). 
It supports MongoDB 4.4.19 protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

* The support for authentication using [AWS IAM](../aws-iam.md) enables you to natively integrate Percona Server for MongoDB with AWS services, increase security of your infrastructure by setting up password-less authentication and offload your DBAs from managing different sets of secrets. This is the [technical preview feature](../glossary.md#technical-preview-feature)
* Improved master key rotation for data at rest encrypted with HashiCorp Vault enables you to use the same secret key path on every server in your entire deployment thus significantly simplifying the secrets management and key rotation process.

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-68122](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68122) - Fixed the issue with adding a new unencrypted node into an encrypted replica set by removing options which might not apply for this node.
* [SERVER-71759](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-71759) - Changed the yielding policy of dataSize command to YIELD_AUTO for both when the command is called with estimate:true or false
* [SERVER-72222](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72222) - Fixed the incorrect behavior of the `mapReduce` command with single reduce optimization in sharded clusters
* [SERVER-72535](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72535) - Disallow creating the ‘admin’, ‘local’, and ‘config’ databases with alternative cases in names on sharded clusters
* [SERVER-70235](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-70235) - Fixed the issue with the upgrade from 4.2 to 4.4 when the UUID of the collections don't match by skipping the creation of range deletion documents upon upgrade
