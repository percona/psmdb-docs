## Release Highlights

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [WT-10551](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-10551) - Fixed the bug with WiredTiger failing to load the incremental backup change bitmap for a file. The issue affects MongoDB versions 4.4.8 through 4.4.21, 5.0.2 through 5.0.17, and 6.0.0 through 6.0.5 causing the server to crash with the checksum error if the affected incremental backup was restored and the affected data is accessed.

    If you are using incremental backups, upgrade to the fixed upstream version 4.4.22 / Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.22-21 as soon as possible. Follow closely the upstream recommendations to remediate the negative impact.  

* [SERVER-48196](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-48196) - Updated the built-in timezone files the latest version by upgrading the timezone library

* [SERVER-57056](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-57056) - Fixed the syslog severity level for INFO messages
