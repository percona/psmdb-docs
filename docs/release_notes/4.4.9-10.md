## Release Highlights

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:


* [WT-7426](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-7426) - After upgrade to v4.4.5, startups or restarts can trigger WiredTigers RTS bug which can corrupt page metadata causing documents on affected pages to become invisible to MongoDB. This can lead to temporary query incorrectness, or more likely a fatal error and inability to restart. Affects only MongoDB 4.4.5 and Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.5-7.


* [SERVER-58936](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-58936) - Unique Index constraint violations possible - can cause duplicate data - fixed in version 4.4.8.


* [WT-7995](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-7995) - Checkpoint thread can read and persist inconsistent version of data to disk. Can cause Duplicate Key error on startup and prevent the node from starting. Unclean shutdowns can cause data inconsistency within documents, deleted documents to still exist, incomplete query results due to lost or inaccurate index entries, and/or missing documents. Affects MongoDB versions 4.4.2 through 4.4.8 and Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.2-4 - 4.4.8-9 as well as MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.2. Upgrade to fixed version of MongoDB 4.4.9 / Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.9-10 as soon as possible.


* WT-7984 and associated Server Bug SERVER-60371.


* [WT-7984](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-7984) - Bug that could cause Checkpoint thread to omit a page of data. If the server experiences an unclean shutdown, an inconsistent checkpoint is used for recovery and causes data corruption. Fixed in version 4.4.9.
Requires the [validate](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/validate/)  command to be run and possible data remediation via complete initial sync.


* [SERVER-60371](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60371) - If previously upgraded to version 4.4.8 then upgrade to 4.4.9, could still experience Duplicate Key error and Fatal assertion. Related to the two previous WiredTiger bugs.

Requires the [validate](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/validate/) command to be run and possible data remediation via complete initial sync. Currently under review.

## Improvements


* [PSMDB-918](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PSMDB-918): Disable the ability to delete the mongod user in RPM packages - This preserves the permissions to the MongoDB data directory for the `mongod` user as its user ID and group ID remain unchanged.
