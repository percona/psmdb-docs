[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.7-4 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB Community Edition 7.0.5.

Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.7-4 includes the improvements and bug fixes of [MongoDB 7.0.6 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0/#7.0.6---feb-28--2024) and [MongoDB 7.0.7 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0/#7.0.7---mar-18--2024).

It supports protocols and drivers of both MongoDB 7.0.6 and MongoDB 7.0.7.

!!! warning

    Due to [CVE-2024-1351](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1351), in all MongoDB versions prior to 4.4.29, the `mongod` server allows incoming connections to skip peer certificate validation which results in untrusted connections to succeed. This issue occurs when the `mongod` is started with TLS enabled (`net.tls.mode` set to `allowTLS`, `preferTLS`, or `requireTLS`) and without a `net.tls.CAFile` configured. For details, see [SERVER-72839](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72839).

    The issue is fixed upstream in versions 4.4.29, 5.0.25, 6.0.14 and 7.0.6 and in Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.29-28, 5.0.25-22, 6.0.14-11 and 7.0.7-4. Now, configuring MongoDB to use TLS requires specifying the value for the `--tlsCAFile` flag, the `net.tls.CAFile `configuration option, or the `tlsUseSystemCA` parameter.

* [SERVER-82353 ](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-82353) - Fixed the issue with multi-document transactions missing documents when the movePrimary operation runs concurrently by detecting placement conflicts in multi-document transactions.
* [SERVER-72703](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72703) - Changed the requirement to use exclusive write lock to intent exclusive write lock that doesn't prevent reading from a collection during the `$out` stage when running the rename collection command.

* [SERVER-84628](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-84628) - Improved the warning about persisted Read/Write Consern defaults on startup by showing it only for shard servers. 
* [SERVER-85459](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-85459) - In mixed replica sets where nodes have different Feature Compatibilty Version value, the primary nodes reject the commands with parameters that cannot be recognized by other replica set members.
* [SERVER-85869](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-85869) - Fixed the issue with exhaustive find command on config shard returning stale data by making shard registry use snapshot readConcern for reads from `config.shards` collection.
