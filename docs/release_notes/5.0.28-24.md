Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.28-24 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0.x Community Edition. 

Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.28-24 includes improvements and bug fixes of [MongoDB 5.0.28 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.28---jul-15--2024) and supports its protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

* This release of Percona Server for MongoDB includes the enhanced telemetry feature and provides comprehensive information about how telemetry works, its components and metrics as well as updated methods how to disable telemetry. Read more in [Telemetry on Percona Server for MongoDB](../telemetry.md)
* The enhanced approach to handling master encryption keys and [regular check of their state](../kmip.md#key-state-polling) reduces the mean time to resolve compromised encryption key incidents.  
* Tarballs are now available for each supported operating system individually and no longer include built-in libraries. This change reduces the tarball download size and increases their security by simplifying updates for required dependencies. 

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-63198](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-63198) - Prevented shutdown command from hanging
* [SERVER-90747](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-90747) - Improve handling of queries with $elemMatch with empty path in plan enumerator in case an index is used on another predicate of the query
* [SERVER-91362](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91362) - Fixed performance issues by not copying a JavaScript "scope" object if a cached JsExecution object already exists in a query thread
* [SERVER-91562](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91562) - Fixed the issue with incorrect handling of 'unique' and 'sparse' parameters in index signature when comparing indexes.
