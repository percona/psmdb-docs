# Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.28-24 ({{date.5_0_28}})

[Installation](../install/index.md){.md-button}

Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.28-24 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0.x Community Edition. 

Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.28-24 includes improvements and bug fixes of [MongoDB 5.0.28 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.28---jul-15--2024) and supports its protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

This release of Percona Server for MongoDB includes the following features and improvements:

### Enhanced Telemetry for better product usage reporting

The enhanced telemetry feature provides comprehensive information about how it works, its components and metrics as well as updated methods how to disable telemetry. Read more in [Telemetry on Percona Server for MongoDB](../telemetry.md)

### Reduce mean time to resolve (MTTR) compromised encryption key incidents in KMIP

Starting with this release, Percona Server for MongoDB automatically activates the master encryption keys at startup and periodically checks (polls) their status in a KMIP server. If a master encryption key for a node is not in the Active state, the node reports an error and shuts down. This method allows security engineers to quickly identify which nodes require out-of-schedule master key rotation, such as in the case of compromised keys, without needing to rotate keys for the entire cluster. 

Learn more about key state polling from [documentation](../kmip.md#key-state-polling) 

### Easier dependency management with thinner tarballs 

Tarballs are now available for each supported operating system individually and no longer include built-in libraries. This change reduces the tarball download size and increases their security by simplifying updates for required dependencies. 

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-63198](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-63198) - Prevented shutdown command from hanging
* [SERVER-90747](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-90747) - Improve handling of queries with $elemMatch with empty path in plan enumerator in case an index is used on another predicate of the query
* [SERVER-91362](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91362) - Fixed performance issues by not copying a JavaScript "scope" object if a cached JsExecution object already exists in a query thread
* [SERVER-91562](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-91562) - Fixed the issue with incorrect handling of 'unique' and 'sparse' parameters in index signature when comparing indexes.
