The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-50792](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-50792) - Extend error message to provide more information why the index is invalid
* [SERVER-80021](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80021) - Fixed the conversion form string to doubleValue to not lose precision and be able to rountrip and retrieve the same value back.
* [SERVER-81106](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81106) - Improved the recipient shard behavior during the chunk migration to wait for changes to catalog cache to be persisted before the cloning phase.
* [SERVER-81966](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81966) - Fixed the issue that caused the modification of the original ChunkMap vector during the chunk migration and that could lead to data loss. The issue affects MongoDB versions 4.4.25, 5.0.21, 6.0.10 through 6.0.11 and 7.0.1 through 7.0.2. Requires stopping all chunk merge activities and restarting all the binaries in the cluster (both `mongod` and `mongos`). Please follow closely the upstream recommendations how to remediate the issue.
* [WT-10424](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-10424) - Improved the performance of the search_near WiredTiger cursor operation if many deleted items are present by reducing the cache size.
