|----------------- | ---------------- | 
| **Installation** | [Installing Percona Server for MongoDB](../install/index.md)|



Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.13-13 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.4.13 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 4.4.13 protocols and drivers.

!!! warning 

    Inconsistent data is observed after the upgrade from MongoDB 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 to versions 4.4.8+ and 5.0.2+.
    This issue is fixed upstream in versions 4.4.11+ and 5.0.6+. Percona Server for MongoDB also includes the fix starting from versions 4.4.12-12 and 5.0.6-5.

    See the upgrade recommendations below:


    * Clusters on versions 4.4.0 and 4.4.1 are safe to upgrade to 4.4.8+ or 5.0.2+ but should upgrade to recommended versions 4.4.11+ or 5.0.5+.


    * Clusters on versions 4.4.2, 4.4.3, or 4.4.4 should **downgrade** to 4.4.1 and then upgrade to versions  4.4.11+ or 5.0.5+.


    * Clusters running versions 4.4.5 - 4.4.7 can and should upgrade to versions 4.4.11+ or 5.0.5+.

    Note that clusters running versions 4.4.2 - 4.4.8 are affected by the bug [WT-7995](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-7995). See [WT-7995](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-7995) for specific explanation and instructions on running the [validate](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/validate/) command to check for data inconsistencies. These data inconsistencies can lead to data loss if not identified and repaired at this point between versions 4.4.8 and 4.4.9.

    If the [validate](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/validate/)  command output reports any failures, resync the impacted node from an unaffected node.   **The validate command must be run against all collections in the database. This process can be resource intensive and can negatively impact performance.**

## Release Highlights

Percona Server for MongoDB now supports [Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)](../kmip.md) so that users can store encryption keys in their favorite KMIP-compatible key manager to set up encryption at rest. This is a tech preview feature.

The list of bug fixes introduced by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB is the following:


* [SERVER-63203](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-63203) - Fixed the issue where having a large number of split points causes the chunk splitter to not function correctly and huge chunks would not be split without manual intervention. This can be caused when having small shard key ranges and a very high number of documents and where more than 8192 split points would be needed.


* [SERVER-62065](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-62065) - Added the `repairShardedCollectionChunksHistory` command to restore history fields for some chunks. This aims to fix broken snapshot reads and distributed transactions.


* [SERVER-59754](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59754) - Fixed incorrect logging of queryHash/planCacheKey for operations that share the same `$lookup` shape


* [SERVER-55483](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-55483) - Added a new startup parameter that skips verifying the table logging settings on restarting as a replica set node from the standalone mode during the restore. This speeds up the restore process.
