Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.17-17 is an enhanced, source available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.4.17 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 4.4.17 protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights


* [Data-at-rest encryption using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)](../kmip.md#kmip) is generally available enabling you to use it in your production environment


* [$backupCursor and $backupCursorExtend aggregation stages](../backup-cursor.md#backup-cursor) functionality is generally available, enabling your application developers to use it for building custom backup solutions.

**NOTE**: Percona provides [Percona Backup for MongoDB](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/index.html) - the open source tool for consistent backups and restores in MongoDB sharded clusters.


* Fixed security vulnerability [CVE-2022-3602](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-3602) for Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.15-15 and higher installed from tarballs on Ubuntu 22.04.

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:


* [SERVER-68925](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68925) - Detect and resolve table logging inconsistencies for WiredTiger tables at startup


* [SERVER-56127](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-56127) - Fixed retryable writes on update and delete commands to not execute more than once if chunk is migrated and shard key pattern uses nested fields


* [SERVER-64142](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-64142) - Verify that any unique indexes are prefixed by the new shard key pattern


* [SERVER-65382](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-65382) - Prevent the use of `clientReadable` function in `AutoSplitVector` when reordering shard key fields
