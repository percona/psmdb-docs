## Release Highlights


* Support of [multiple KMIP servers](../kmip.md#kmip) adds failover to your data-at-rest encryption setup.


* Allow users to set KMIP client certificate password through a flag to simplify the migration from MongoDB Enterprise to *Percona Server for MongoDB*.


* *Percona Server for MongoDB* is now available on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).

Other improvements and bug fixes introduced by MongoDB and included in *Percona Server for MongoDB* are the following:


* [SERVER-58506](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-58506) - Extend the `getParameter` command output with the information about a parameter to be enabled on runtime or only on startup


* [SERVER-62272](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-62272) - Ensure that applying schema validation rules to a non-empty collection prevents chunk migration for the data that existed before these rules were applied.


* [SERVER-66176](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66176) - Improve the `CollectionCatalog` workflow by making hashing before taking a lock and adding an API for restoring after yield.


* [SERVER-61097](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61097) - Fixed the issue with cache eviction causing deadlocks by allowing a transaction to time itself out
