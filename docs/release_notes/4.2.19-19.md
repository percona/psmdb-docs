Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.19-19 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2.19 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 4.2.19-19 protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

Percona Server for MongoDB now supports [Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)](../kmip.md#kmip) so that users can store encryption keys in their favorite KMIP-compatible key manager to set up encryption at rest. This is a tech preview feature.

The list of bug fixes introduced by MongoDB and included in *Percona Server for MongoDB* is the following:


* [SERVER-62065](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-62065) - Added the `repairShardedCollectionChunksHistory` command to restore history fields for some chunks. This aims to fix broken snapshot reads and distributed transactions.


* [SERVER-60685](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60685) - Fixed an issue with transaction coordinator crashing if the transaction is aborted when attempting to commit a transaction.


* [SERVER-60682](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60682) - Fixed the issue with the distributed transactions being in the prolonged prepared state that was caused by the  blocking of acquiring the WiredTiger write tickets by the transaction coordinator.


* [SERVER-40691](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-40691) - Fixed an issue with an empty array for the `$nin` statement.
