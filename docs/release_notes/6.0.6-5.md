| Release date | May 25, 2023|
|------------- | ---------------|
| **Installation** | [Installing Percona Server for MongoDB](../install/index.md) |


Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.6-5 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 6.0.6 Community Edition.

It is based on [MongoDB 6.0.6 Community edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0/#6.0.6---may-12--2023) and supports the upstream protocols and drivers.

!!! warning

    We don't recommend this version for production use due to the issue with routing sharding time series collections [SERVER-80203](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80203) which could result in metadata inconsistency. The routing issue is observed when documents have the shard key containing the embedded object composed of multiple fields. 

    The issue affects time series sharded collections starting in MongoDB version 5.0.6 through versions 5.0.21, 6.0.11 and 7.0.2. It is fixed upstream in versions 5.0.22, 6.0.12 and 7.0.4 and included in Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.22-19, 6.0.12-9 and 7.0.4-2.

    If you are using time series collections, upgrade to the fixed version of MongoDB / Percona Server for MongoDB as soon as possible and follow closely the upstream recommendations outlined in [SERVER-80203](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80203) for remediation steps.
    

## Release Highlights

Improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following:

* [SERVER-51835](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-51835) - Fixed the handling of the read preference tags to respect their order and ignore other tags when all eligible replica set members are found.
* [SERVER-67105](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-67105) - Allowed usage of clustered index in queries.
* [SERVER-72774](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72774) - Prevented a node in quiesce mode to win election.
* [SERVER-74930](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-74930) - Fixed the issue with the `$avg` operator to return the sum instead of the average within a `$group` stage
* [SERVER-75205](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-75205) - Fixed deadlock between `stepdown` and `restoring` locks after yielding when all read tickets exhausted
* [WT-10551](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-10551) - Fixed the bug with WiredTiger failing to load the incremental backup change bitmap for a file. The issue affects MongoDB versions 4.4.8 through 4.4.21, 5.0.2 through 5.0.17, and 6.0.0 through 6.0.5 causing the server to crash with the checksum error if the affected incremental backup was restored and the affected data is accessed.

    If you are using incremental backups, upgrade to the fixed upstream version 6.0.6 / Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.6-5 as soon as possible. Follow closely the upstream recommendations to remediate the negative impact.
