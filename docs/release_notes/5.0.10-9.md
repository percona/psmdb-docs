| **Release date** | August 09, 2022 |
|----------------- | ---------------- | 
| **Installation** | [Installing Percona Server for MongoDB](../install/index.md)|

Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.10-9 is an enhanced, source available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0.10 Community Edition.

It is rebased on [MongoDB 5.0.10 Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.9---may-31--2022) and supports MongoDB 5.0.10 protocols and drivers.

!!! warning 

    We don’t recommend this version for the production use due to the critical issue with sharding metadata inconsistency: [SERVER-68511](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68511). The metadata inconsistency is observed when running the `movePrimary` command on the database that has the Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) set to 4.4 or earlier. Affects MongoDB versions 5.0.0 through 5.0.10 and MongoDB 6.0.0. Upgrade to the fixed version of MongoDB 5.0.11 / Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.11-10 as soon as possible.

    Please follow closely the upstream recommendations outlined in [SERVER-68511](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68511) to work around this issue and for the remediation steps, if your cluster is affected.

## Release Highlights

This release includes bug fixes and improvements provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB. It specifically includes multiple fixes relate to sharding and the resharding operation. Bugs of note are the following:

* [SERVER-66418](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66418) -  Fixed the issue with bad projection created during dependency analysis due to string order assumption. It resulted in the `PathCollision` error. The issue is fixed by improving dependency analysis for projections by folding dependencies into ancestor dependencies where possible.

* [SERVER-65821](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-65821) - Fixed the deadlock situation in cross shard transactions that could occur when the FCV (Feature Compatibility Version) was set after the “prepared” state of the transactions. That ended up with both the the [setFCV](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/) thread and the `TransactionCoordinator` hung.

* [SERVER-65131](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-65131) - This is a v6.0 backport fix to v5.0 that disables opportunistic read targeting (except for specified hedged reads) in order to prevent possible performance problems associated with uneven read distribution across the secondaries.

* [SERVER-66433](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66433) - Backported the check for user errors in case deadline on the migration destination manager is hit while waiting for a range to be cleared up. This prevents the balancer from getting blocked.

* [SERVER-67457](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-67457) - Fixed the situation where the shards may skip certain steps in the resharding process but respond to the resharding coordinator as if they had. This can cause the resharding coordinator to continue to wait for updated states in the `config.reshardingOperations` document on the primary config server and stall indefinitely.

* [SERVER-66866](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66866) - Fixed the potential for the range deleter to wait unnecessarily during concurrent migrations between batches.

* [SERVER-66727](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66046) Fixed the issue where 2 very different measurements (one in the past and one in future) could be incorrectly included in the same buckettime-series bucket.

* [SERVER-64433](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-64433) - Resolved potential problem when adding or removing shards and incorrectly gossiping a new topology time without it being majorly committed.
