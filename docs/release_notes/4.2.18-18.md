## Release Highlights

The bug fixes and improvements, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:


* [SERVER-56227](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-56227) - Added the SetAllowMigrationsCommand command that prevents the balancer to migrate chunks on shards.


* [SERVER-56226](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-56226) Added a flag for the config server that prevents new migrations to start and ongoing migrations to commit.


* [SERVER-61427](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61427) - Skip running duplicate key handler if the exact key already exists in the table. This fixes availability loss during the index build that was caused by checking many false duplicates.


* [SERVER-54064](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-54064) Added periodic clean up of logical sessions cache on arbiters
