## Release Highlights

* [AWS IAM authentication](../aws-iam.md) is now generally available, enabling you to use this functionality in production environments.

* Percona Server for MongoDB now includes telemetry that fills in the gaps in our understanding of how you use Percona Server for MongoDB to improve our products. Participation in the anonymous program is optional. You can opt-out if you prefer not to share this information. [Read more about Telemetry](../telemetry.md). 

Improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following:

* [SERVER-80203](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-80203) - Fixed the routing issue with sharded time series collections which could result in metadata inconsistency. The issue occurred when the documents that have the shard key containing the embedded object composed of multiple fields are routed to an incorrect shard and become orphanated. As a result orphanated documents may not be returned when queried through the mongos and/or may be deleted. The issue affects time series sharded collections starting in MongoDB version 5.0.6 through versions 5.0.21, 6.0.11 and 7.0.2. 

   If you are using time series collections, upgrade to MongoDB 6.0.12 or Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.12-9 as soon as possible. Please follow closely the upstream recommendations to identify and preserve orphanated documents. 

* [SERVER-69244](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-69244) - Fixed the behaviour of the `$merge` aggregation stage on sharded clusters when the default read concern has been set to "majority"
* [SERVER-81295](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81295) - Fixed the issue with the migration of change stream pipelines to use v2 resume tokens instead of v1
* [SERVER-81966](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-81966) - Fixed the issue that caused the modification of the original ChunkMap vector during the chunk migration and that could lead to data loss. The issue affects MongoDB versions 4.4.25, 5.0.21, 6.0.10 through 6.0.11 and 7.0.1 through 7.0.2. Requires stopping all chunk merge activities and restarting all the binaries in the cluster (both `mongod` and `mongos`). 
* [WT-11564](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-11564) - Fixed the rollback-to-stable behavior to read the newest transaction value only when it exists in the checkpoint.
