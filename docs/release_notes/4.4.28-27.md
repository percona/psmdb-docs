## Release Highlights

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-77506](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-77506) - Fixed the issue with the data and the ShardVersion mismatch for sharded multi-document transactions by adding the check that no chunk has moved for the collection being referenced since transaction started
* [SERVER-82365](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-82365) - Improved cluster balancer performance by optimizing the construction of the balancer's collection distribution status histogram
* [SERVER-82883](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-82883) - Fixed the issue with blocking acquiring read/write tickets by TransactionCoordinator by validating that it can be recovered on step-up and can commit the transaction when there are no storage tickets available
* [WT-7929](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-7929) - Investigated a solution to avoid a Full Time Diagnostic Data Capture (FTDC) mechanism to stall during checkpoint
