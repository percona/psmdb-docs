Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.23-23 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 4.2.23 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 4.2.23 protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights


* [Data-at-rest encryption using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)](../kmip.md) is generally available enabling you to use it in your production environment


* [$backupCursor and $backupCursorExtend aggregation stages](../backup-cursor.md) functionality is generally available, enabling your application developers to use it for building custom backup solutions.

    !!! note 

        Percona provides [Percona Backup for MongoDB](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/index.html) - the open source tool for consistent backups and restores in MongoDB sharded clusters.

* Fixed security vulnerability [CVE-2022-3602](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-3602) for *Percona Server for MongoDB* 4.2.21-21 and higher installed from tarballs on Ubuntu 22.04.
