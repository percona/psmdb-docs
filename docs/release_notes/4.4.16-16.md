!!! warning

    Take caution when upgrading from earlier versions of v4.4.x to later versions of 4.4 or on to v5.0. See [SERVER-68511](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-68511) for more details.

## Release Highlights


* [SERVER-67302](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-67302) - Fixed the server crash with the CLOCK_REALTIME set to forward by making the linearizable reads robust to primary catch-up and simultaneous stepdown.


* [SERVER-61321](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-61321), [SERVER-60607](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60607) - Improved handling of large/NaN (Not a Number) values for text index and geo index version.


* [SERVER-66418](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-66418) -  Fixed the issue with bad projection created during dependency analysis due to string order assumption. It resulted in the `PathCollision` error. The issue is fixed by improving dependency analysis for projections by folding dependencies into ancestor dependencies where possible.


* [WT-9096](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-9096) - Fixed the wrong key/value returning during search near when the key doesn’t exist.


* [SERVER-63243](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-63243) - This bug fix adjusts the functioning of the range-deleter to prevent the balancer from getting blocked, hung, or ranges being scheduled behind other ranges.


* [SERVER-67492](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-67492) - Failed chunk migrations can lead to recipient shard having different config.transactions records between primaries and secondaries - inconsistent data.


* [SERVER-60958](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60958) - This fix avoids server hang in chunk migration when a step-down occurs.
