## Release Highlights

The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB, are the following:

* [SERVER-51835](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-51835) - Fixed the handling of the read preference tags to respect their order and ignore other tags when all eligible replica set members are found
* [SERVER-75205](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-75205) - Fixed deadlock between `stepdown` and `restoring` locks after yielding when all read tickets exhausted
* [WT-9500](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT-9500) - Prevent rollback to stable operation to generate wrong updates/tombstones by always reading the cell time window information to decide the history store update visibility.
* [SERVER-73229](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-73229) - Fixed the issue with early kills of the cursor during the logical session cache refresh by properly handling write errors.
* [SERVER-75261](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-75261) - Added accounting for array element overhead for "listCollections", "listIndexes", "_shardsvrCheckMetadataConsistencyParticipant" commands
* [SERVER-75431](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-75431) - Improved the rename path behavior for a collection in sharded clusters by fixing the check for the databases to reside on the same primary shard 
* [SERVER-76098](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-76098) - Allowed queries with search and non-simple collations
