|------------- | ---------------|
| **Installation** | [Installing Percona Server for MongoDB](../install/index.md) |


Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.5-4 is an enhanced, source-available, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 6.0.5 Community Edition.

It is rebased on [MongoDB 6.0.5 Community edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0/#6.0.5---mar-13--2023) and supports the upstream protocols and drivers.

## Release Highlights

* Added support for [authentication using AWS IAM](../aws-iam.md) enables you to natively integrate Percona Server for MongoDB with AWS services, increase security of your infrastructure by setting up password-less authentication and offload your DBAs from managing different sets of secrets. This is a [technical preview feature](../glossary.md#technical-preview-feature)
* Improved master key rotation for data at rest encrypted with HashiCorp Vault enables you to use the same secret key path on every server in your entire deployment thus significantly simplifying the secrets management and key rotation process.
